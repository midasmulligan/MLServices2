0,Brexit,"
        thereâs a rather obvious problem with jeremy corbynâs new year strategy of trying to copy donald trumpâs populism, which is that heâs not remotely like the billionaire property magnate. of course, the labour leader doesnât say he is trying to copy trump, but he and his advisers do think that the successes of âpopulismâ in the american election and in the eu referendum hold important lessons for them.â 

âthe leave and trump campaigns succeeded,â corbyn told the fabian society annual meeting this morning, âbecause they both recognised the system was broken and the people werenât being listened to.â

which was why, quite by chance and not because he was copying trump at all, he said: âthe people who run britain have been taking our country for a ride â¦ theyâve rigged the economy and business rules to line the pockets of their friends â¦ labour under my leadership stands for a complete break with this rigged system.ââ 

it doesnât have the same sentence structure as trump: âyou know, the system, folks, is rigged. itâs a rigged system.â but the idea is the same.

and corbyn sees the brexit campaign as part of the same lesson. âis it really a surprise,â he asked the fabians, âthat when people were offered the chance to âmake their country great againâ or to âtake back controlâ that many voted for it? for some, it was their first chance to exercise a bit of real power and say what they thought about a system stacked against them.â

he tried to copy some of vote leaveâs rhetoric, too, although this was a bit feeble: âwe will hand back wealth and control to people and communities.â and he gave up before trying to offer a labour version of âmake britain great againâ.â 

the other big lesson of trumpâs victory for corbyn, although he cannot talk about it for obvious reasons, is that with trump what you see is what you get. the president-elect is two things: he is not a professional politician, and he is authentic.â 

corbyn, who has been an mp for 34 years, can hardly pretend not to be a politician, but he has been a nonconformist all that time. he has always opposed the government, even when it was a government of his own party. hence the part of his speech today that infuriated so many of his opponents (âotherwise referred to as âlabour mpsâ and âvotersââ, as former mp tom harris put it). those people who âtook our country for a rideâ, according to corbyn, included those who âput the country at risk by taking us into disastrous foreign warsâ, an obvious reference to he who shall not be named. even the muggles in his audience could decode that one.â 



  

corbyn: theresa may is in denial over the nhs crisis

corbynâs hostility to everything that the labour party previously stood for is also the guarantee of his authenticity. his reputation is built on saying what he has always said, which is what he thinks, rather than some pasteurised sound bites taken from focus-group transcripts.â 

itâs a bit overdone, naturally, because corbyn is actually quite careful about what he says, which is not something that anyone could say about trump. at his news conference on wednesday, the way he talks, without notes, in streams of consciousness and saying unexpected things, was as unrestrained and trumpian as ever. corbyn simply doesnât have the confidence to talk like that.â 

nor is corbyn as straightforward as his supporters claim. he has, most notably, been disingenuous about his real views on brexit. but then trump used to be a democrat. authenticity is not the same as policy consistency.â 

the problem for corbyn in trying to be a populist is that he simply isnât equipped to do it effectively. partly, this is because he is not a âcharacterâ, well known to the public, in the way that trump, boris johnson and nigel farage are. he is not a natural communicator. some of his advisers try to make a virtue of this, presenting him as a self-effacing chairman of the team in the attlee mould, but it hasnât yet elicited the respect that attlee commanded from the wider electorate.â

corbyn says he hasn't 'lost control of party' after hunt resignation



there are some elements of long-standing labour values that lend themselves to populism. tony blair was for the many not the few. even ed miliband tried to present himself as the avenging fury of the oppressed against the predatory capitalists. so when corbyn promises to âbreak the grip of vested interestsâ heâs saying what labour leaders have always said. the trouble is that itâs not very different from what theresa may is saying, and she says it a bit better than he is.â 

the big reason that corbyn cannot copy trump, however, is that he hasnât learned the lesson of how trump won. it wasnât simply by railing against the ârigged systemâ. trump won by taking a coalition of the republican base â minus the elite parts of it such as the bush family â and bolting on to it two constituencies that mitt romney had failed to mobilise four years before. trump won over enough working-class democrats and non-voters to get him over the line in the rust belt swing states that mattered.â 

corbyn isnât even holding on to labourâs core vote, let alone winning over parts of the electorate that the party failed to win in 2015. he mustâ be the most unpopular populist in modern british politics.

        william hague, the former tory leader and foreign secretary, wants eu citizens to be automatically given work permits if they come to work in britain or already live and work here after brexit. it is not clear how this differs from the worker registration scheme set up when i was minister of europe in 2004, when the decision was taken to let eu workers come to the uk.

then, the uk already had hundreds of thousands of polish residents and other eastern europeans who took advantage of visa free travel to come to britain and work illegally. the eu worker registration scheme combined with the requirement to have national insurance cards meant enhanced internal control.

lord hague appears to be saying that all eu workers who find a job can automatically be given a work permit. that is no different from the worker registration scheme and is a form of internal rather than external control on worker movement such as quotas, requiring a job offer in writing before coming to the uk, or seasonal worker systems.

this move from external to internal controls on free movement, proposed by lord hague, should be welcomed as they do not, on the face of it, contradict eu treaty law and rules. they are also in line with what the swiss have recently decided after their own referendum in february 2014, which voted to ban eu immigration.

at the annual new year gathering of british and swiss parliamentarians, christa markwalder, a swiss liberal mp and the youngest ever chair of the swiss parliament, explained to tory mps how the swiss handled their february 2014 referendum mandating an end to eu immigration.

âlike you we also had an important referendum three years ago about âtaking back controlâ of immigration to switzerland. a tight majority of the voters accepted itâ, she told them.

âas the dust settled and excitement died away we began to see that the emotion of saying âmanaging immigration ourselvesâ may answer a question on a ballot paper. but it does not answer the question of what should be done.

âit should be clear that we cannot shut borders and hope to survive, let alone prosper. so in the three years since the referendum of february 2014 we parliamentarians and the economic actors of switzerland had to decide whether emotion against foreigners should have greater weight than the economic interests of our country.

âwe had many talks with the eu and the message was firm and clear. brussels respected the swiss referendum but could not change the rules and treaty obligations that the 28 eu member states had agreed to live under.

âand so in the end we produced a compromise based on strengthening internal controls of our labour market instead of preventing european citizens getting access to jobs in switzerland.â

this proposal has won support of the swiss peopleâs party, which has always taken a hard line on switzerland getting too close to the eu.â 

these internal controls are based on a requirement for firms to advertise jobs locally so that any swiss citizen can apply and be interviewed. if the swiss candidate is not qualified or suitable then the swiss firm may turn to an eu worker. this compromise based on internal rather than external controls has been accepted by brussels.

now austriaâs social democratic chancellor christian kern has made a similar suggestion as austria and switzerland copycat each other; and vienna politicians often follow swiss initiatives.



  

labour does not rule out backing freedom of movement after brexit, says corbyn

next year austria goes to the polls and the strong showing for the far right austrian freedom party (fpã) in the presidential election in december means the social democrats need to regain working class votes.

but the austrian idea is not based on external controls. eu freedom of movement does not apply to state employment and local labour markets can demand qualifications or id checks on social security contributions within eu rules. william hagueâs proposal needs spelling out but the automatic granting of a work permit is just an updating of the 2004 worker registration scheme. it is different from the calls by some labour mps for external controls, like having a job offer in writing before getting on ryanair flight to come to the uk or quotas for different regions.

like the swiss plan this avoids directly confronting the eu by imposing cold war era external controls on workers from europe who want to add to the british economy.â

        theresa may has beenâ given a one-month deadline to finally end the secrecy surrounding her brexit strategy,â a hard-hitting report by mps revealedâ today.

crucial issues including membership of the euâs single market and customs union â and plans for a âtransitional dealââ â must be revealed by the middle of february, they say.

the prime minister is also told to guarantee her promised brexit plan is a fully fleshed-out white paper, rather than a rumoured brief note.

theresa may will make her long-awaited brexit speech next week



and she is warned of the stark âcliff edgeâ danger to businesses if britain crashes out of the eu with no deal at all, in 2019 â a scenario favoured by some hardline tory mps.

it would be âextremely disruptiveâ and could lead to some firms âre-locating out of the uk or investing elsewhere in futureâ, the report says.

it is the first issued by the commonsââ new cross-party brexit select committee, whose members include prominent tory leave supporters michael gove, dominic raab and peter lilley.

the committee also demands that parliament is granted a vote on the final brexit deal â after the prime minister hinted she would deny one.

hilary benn, its labour chairman, said: âthis is going to be a hugely complex task and the outcome will affect us all.

âthe government needs to publish its brexit plan by mid-february at the latest, including its position on membership of the single market and the customs union, so that it can be scrutinised by parliament and the public.â

later than mid-february would deny mps sufficient time to debate and vote on the plan before the prime minister kicks off negotiations by tabling article 50 at the end of march.



  

2016: the year of brexit

ms may should âseek appropriate transitional arrangements in the interests of businessâ, if no final trade deal could be concluded by the time britain leaves the eu, probably in 2019, mr benn said.

and he added: âwhatever deal is concluded, parliament must be given a vote on it and the government should make this clear now.â

the report is released three days before the prime ministerâs long-awaited brexit speech, during which she has promised to reveal âmore detailsâ.

however, many mps fear and expect that she will continue to fall back on slogans about her ambition to secure the âbest possible dealâ for britain â rather than set out her negotiating strategy.

earlier this week, ms may refused to confirm she intends to pull britain out of the single market, despite saying she would not âkeep bits of membership of the euâ.

even her hints were enough to send the pound to its lowest level since october, as the markets interpreted her remarks as evidence of a looming âhard brexitâ.

unsurprisingly, the 21-strong committee â with both leave and remain backers â does not reach a view on whether britain should stay in the single market or customs union.

however, its unanimous report does use stark language to raise the threat of the âcliff edgeâ, something ms may herself appeared to recognise in a speech last year.

if britain leaves the euâs trading arrangements â and cannot strike a new deal within two years â it will fall back on world trade organisation (wto) rules.

this, the committee points out, will mean hefty export tariffs on, for example, dairy products (36 per cent), cars (ten per cent), food and drink (20 per cent) and clothing and textiles (10-20 per cent).

the report reads: âa âcliff edgeâ change in circumstances could be extremely disruptive in some sectors to businesses both in the uk and in the eu.â

a transitional deal is also needed to ensure âmutually beneficial cooperation on defence, foreign policy, security, financial crime and the fight against terrorism is not brought to an abrupt end by brexitâ.

the report also argues it is âessentialâ that the stability of northern ireland â already facing a snap election, after power-sharing broke down â is not jeopardised by eu withdrawal.

the devolved administrations in scotland, wales and northern ireland, as well as the english regions, must be âduly involvedâ in the process and have their views taken into account.

mr benn added: âweâre not asking the government to give away its red lines or negotiating fall back positions, but we do want clarity on its broad aims.â

        nigel farageâ has been accused of misleading donald trump over the state of the brussels bloc by the usâ ambassador to theâ european union.â 

anthony gardner said the former ukip leader had given the president-elect a false impression that more countries might follow britain out of the bloc by inflating the level of euroscepticism in europe.â 

he added thatâ it would be ""lunacy"" to follow ukip's lead in supporting the ""fragmentation of europe"" andâ urged mr trump not to treat the eu as ""dysfunctional"".â 

that approach would be ""fundamentally flawed"", he said.â

                mr farage turned up late to a â£25-a-head âmeet the leaderâ style event in port talbot, wales in december 2014. 

asked why he was late, he blamed immigrants.

âit took me six hours and 15 minutes to get here - it should have taken three-and-a-half to four,â he said.

âthat has nothing to do with professionalism, what it does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof chiefly because of open-door immigration and the fact that the m4 is not as navigable as it used to beâ

                mr farage has used his platform as ukip leader call for people with hiv to be banned from coming to britain.

asked in an interview with newsweek europe in october 2014 who he thought should be allowed to come to the uk, he said: 

âpeople who do not have hiv, to be frank. thatâs a good start. and people with a skill.â

he also repeated similar comments in the 2015 general election leadership debates

when he was told by the presented that he âhonestly would notâ use the slur, mr farage replied: âa lot wouldâ

âin all civil emergencies like this we have an army, we have a bit of a territorial army as well and we have a very, very overburdened police force and border agency,â he said.

                at a q&a on the european union in january 2014 mr farage said there was no discrimination against women causing the gender pay gap.

instead, he said, women were paid less because they were simply âworth far lessâ than many of their male counterparts.

mr gardner, who has served as barack obamaâsâ eu envoy for three years, also used his final news conference to attackâ theresa mayâs brexit stance, callingâ it âdisorderlyâ and âunmanagedâ.

he said: ""for us to be the cheerleaders of brexit and to be encouraging brexit mark 2, mark 3, is the height of folly.â

describing calls to eu institutions from mr trump's aides in recent weeks, gardner said: ""that was the one question that was asked - basically, 'what's the next country to leave?'. which is kind of suggesting that the place is about to fall apart.

""it's just reflective of the general perception, a misperception, a perception that nigel farage is presumably disseminating in washington and it's a caricature.""

the ambassador said mr farage, who had written to him recently requesting a meeting, had misled trump's transition team on the state of the eu.

""we should not depart from 50 years of foreign policy with regard to the eu,"" he said.â ""we should not become the cheerleaders for brexit, particularly if brexit appears more likely to be a hard, disorderly unmanaged brexit.""

mr gardner also urged europeans and the incoming us administration not to break ranks on sanctions against russia over ukraine.

american diplomats shouldâ speak frankly to the new leadership, even if that carried risks to their careers, he said. â

        theresa mayâsâ plans to trigger article 50â couldâ be delayed by months because enacting brexit while northern irelandâs assembly is in crisis may be illegal, the independent has learned.

power-sharing collapsed in the region earlier this week, meaning a snap election for stormont is imminent.

an election is expected to last for at least two months, during which time the northern ireland assembly will be unable to sit and approve decisions.

as a result, the prime minister may be unable to trigger article 50 ââ the formal mechanism by which a country begins to leave the european union ââ as she will be unable to get approval from stormont, thereby delaying her brexit plans even further.

speaking to the independent, leader of theâ anti-sectarianism alliance party, naomi long, said ms may could face a legal challenge from northern irish politicians if she tries to trigger article 50 while stormont is not sitting.

she said: âgiven the timing of this, what weâre going to have is an election taking place and talks [to form a new government at stormont] taking place when any decision would need to be made by the assembly [on brexit].

âthere wonât actually be an assembly there to actually take votes. and that is one of the biggest challenges that we have in terms of the timing.â 

âi think unfortunately because the assembly isnât likely to be in place, to be able to take votes on the issue, we are in a very vulnerable and very weak position. whether that means that article 50 would have to be delayed, may at the end of the day be another case for the court to find out whether the absence of an administration here means that they need to consult with the devolved administration goes.â

ms long added that in the event of such a legal challenge, article 50 could be delayed considerably while a court decides whether stormont must approve plans.

âit could take months. we just donât know, is the truth. as with so much around brexit, itâs an uncertainty,â she said.



  

arlene foster: instability due to sinn fein's ""selfish"" actions

the supreme court is currently deciding whether the devolved administrations in scotland, wales and northern ireland should also be entitled to approve ms mayâs plans to trigger article 50.

during the legal challenge which was heard in december, northern irish lawyers argued that in addition to mps at westminster getting a vote on whether to approve the plans, northern irish politicians at stormont should also get to approve or deny the move. the justice are currently considering the case and their verdict is expected within the next week.

power-sharing at stormont collapsed on monday after sinn fein politician martin mcguinness resigned to protest at how his democratic unionist counterpart arlene foster handled allegations of a financial scandal.

known locally as the âcash for ash scandalâ, ms foster is accused of mishandling a government scheme started in 2012. the programmeâ was designed to encourage local businesses to use renewable heat sources but a loophole meant they were actually paid to burn fuel pointlessly.

it is estimated the scheme will cost the tax payer some â£490m. ms foster has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls to stand down.

on monday, mr mcguinness resigned as deputy first minister, meaning ms foster also lost her position as first minister under power-sharing rules which mean both must be in office for either of them to remain in power.

secretary of state for northern ireland james brokenshire now has until 5pm on monday 16 january to convince sinn fein to nominate a replacement for mr mcguinness in order to save the executive. however, sinn fein has insisted they will not do so and an election now appears unavoidable.

an election is expected to be held within the next eight weeks, which would clash with ms mayâs plans to trigger article 50 by the end of march. the possibility of a legal challenge by northern irish politicians to triggering the mechanism will be a further blow to the prime ministerâs brexit plans, amid criticisms that her governmentâs attempts to enact eu withdrawal have been poorly executed.

        theresa may has rejected russian allegations that mi6 was to blame forâ the âdirty dossierâ of explosive claims about donald trump.

former british spy christopher steele â the dossier's alleged author â has not worked for british intelligence âfor yearsâ, the prime minister said.

the russian embassy in london had alleged that mr steele was still working for mi6 and âbriefing both waysâ against mr trump and moscow, in a twitter post.

is christopher steele a super-spy or a dodgy dossier writer?



it came after mr steele, who spied in moscow in the 1990s, vanished in hiding shortly before the extraordinary dossier made headlines around the world.

ms may spoke for the first time about the controversy at a press conference following talks with her new zealand counterpart in downing street.

she was asked whether the uk government had any involvement in the creation of the dossier, a summary of which was handed to the fbi and to president obama.

âit's a long-standing position that we don't comment on such matters, but i think from everything that you will have seen it is absolutely clear that the individual who produced this dossier has not worked for the uk government for years,â the prime minister replied.

the late-night allegation by the russian embassy appeared to signal another worsening of anglo-russian relations, after many frosty years.

an embassy spokesman said the tweet â which said âmi6 officers are never exâ â âreflected the mood in russiaâ, prompting talk of a fresh cold war.

american newspapers named mr steele as the author of the 35-pageâ dossier, thought to have been commissioned by a wealthy republican donor who opposed mr trump's bid for the white house.

it alleged mr trump had been cosying up to vladimir putin and cavorting with russian prostitutes. the president-elect has dismissed it as âfake newsâ, âphoney stuffâ and âcrapâ.

the controversy overshadowed the main topics of the talks with bill english, the new zealand prime minister, which were trade and security.

international trade secretary liam fox will visit the commonwealth nation in the coming months to begin a dialogue between the two nations with the ultimate aim of striking a post-brexit trade deal.

however, both leaders declined to put a timescale on when such a âboldâ agreement would be reached â ms may hoping it would be âin a reasonable space of timeâ.

she said: âyou know the legal position that we can't formally sign up to free trade agreements while we remain a member of the european union.

âbut as i indicated earlier, a dialogue has started to see how we can scope out the work that needs to be done.â

mr english said he wanted to see a trade deal concluded âas soon as possibleâ after brexit, and his country was the âideal partnerâ for the uk to demonstrate its ability to secure a high-quality agreement.

britain is the second largest foreign investor in new zealand and its fifth largest bilateral trading partner, ms may added.

        sterlingâs âflash crashâ of 7 october â when the pound plunged by 9 per cent against the dollar in seconds in overnight trading â had no âsingle clear driverâ, according to a report by the bank for international settlements (bis).

speculation over the causes of the huge swing in the traded value of sterling had been intense, with suspected culprits ranging from market manipulation, to âfat fingerâ errors by human traders, to malfunctioning automated trading platforms.

but the bis, an umbrella research organisation for central banks, said that âa number of factorsâ had contributed to the crash.

these included:

significant sell orders for sterling from traders
	automatic stop-loss orders
	a financial times report considered to contain negative news for sterling
	inexperienced sterling traders working at that time of night in asia with âlower risk appetiteâ
âthese factors appear to have contributed to the mechanical cessation of trading on the futures exchange and the exhaustion of the limited liquidity on the primary spot fx trading platform, which encouraged further withdrawal of liquidity by providers reliant on data from those venues,â said the bis.

the reports said that fat finger errors by traders could not be ruled out as a factor, but said there was no âhard evidenceâ for this.

on 6 october sterling was trading at $1.26. then, just after midnight, it slumped as low as $1.15 before bouncing back to $1.24.

the 9 per cent crash



sterling today is trading at $1.21, having slipped to a new 31-year low of $1.20 earlier in the week.

it is trading down almost 18 per cent from last juneâs brexit referendum and the flash crash is seen as having increased negative sentiment towards the currency, which slumped a record 10 per cent on the night of 23 june.

the bis concludes that the october crash was not a unique or unprecedented event but âa new data point in what appears to be a series of flash crash events occurring in a broader range of fast electronic markets than was previously the case in the post-crisis eraâ.

it also warns that such events âhave the potential to undermine confidence in financial markets and hence impact the real economy.â



  

what does the falling pound mean for you?

on 15 january 2015 the swiss franc shot up by 40 per cent against the euro in 20 minutes after the swiss central bank unexpectedly removed its cap policy.

there was extreme volatility in us treasury bonds on 15 october 2014.

and there was a flash crash in the us stock market on 6 may 2010, although market manipulation is considered an influence in this instance.â 

a london-based bedroom trader, navinder singh sarao, last year pleaded guilty in a chicago court to market manipulation in relation to that episode, after being extradited from britain.â 

the department of justice alleges sarao made $40m (â£33m) from the crash, which he helped bring about.

        visa restrictions limiting the number of overseas students coming to study in the uk could cost the country up to â£2bn per year, new analysis shows.

forecasts published by the higher policy education institute (hepi) on the potential effects of brexit warned that universities could stand to lose students, consequentially harming the reputation of british higher education.

the reports come amid warnings from academic leaders that the ukâs departure form the eu could spell the âbiggest disasterâ for the industry in decades.

hard brexit could be 'biggest disaster' for uk universities in years



at a public hearing for the education select committee this week, university vice-chancellors said while brexit could provide new opportunities to improve research funding and focus attention on recruiting top student candidates from across the globe, a hard brexit would ultimately be damaging for the sector.

research from the hepi report supported predictions that the uk could increase revenue by upping tuition fees for eu students after brexit, but experts said the potential gained would be lost if the government pushes forward with plans to tighten regulations for student visa applications.

nick hillman, director of hepi, said: âwere the home office to conduct yet another crackdown on international students, then the uk could lose out on â£2bn a year just when we need to show we are open for business like never before.

âremoving international students from the net migration target would be an easy, costless and swift way to signal a change in direction.â

despite cross-party pressure, theresa may has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of removing students from net migration numbers.

the report, which examined the forces affecting international study at british universities, estimates that 20,000 potential students could be put off studying in the uk as a result of visa restrictions.

at the same time, universities could increase tuition fee income by â£187m in the first year alone, as fees for students from eu members rise.

a weaker pound could encourage an extra students from other countries to come to the uk - a potential increase of nine per cent, experts claimed.

new rules for eu and non-eu students could counteract this, however, by reducing enrolments from eu countries by more than 31,000 students - a decline of 57 per cent amounting to a net loss of â£40m in the first year.

older universities will gain the most financially, with oxbridge colleges in particular standing standing to receive over â£10m more in income each year.



  

house of lords blocks controversial higher education bill

less prestigious universities could suffer, however, as international students aim for places at more highly regarded institutions which often have stronger recruitment drives abroad.

while universities would lose almost â£500m a year in fees from 20,000 fewer international students, the uk as a whole would lose a further â£600m a year in the lost spending outside of fees, such as rent and food.

more than â£900m per year would be lost on top of this, from âthe detrimental impact on universitiesâ supply chainsâ, experts claim.

responding to the report, alistair jarvis, deputy chief executive of universities uk, said: âuk universities remain highly attractive to international students and staff from around the world, despite fierce global competition and significant challenges in terms of our immigration system.

âeu and international staff provide a big boost to the economy, create jobs in all corners of the uk and also enrich our campuses and the experience of uk students, both academically and culturally.

âthis report provides a stark warning of the potential economic loss associated with policies that restrict european or international student numbers.

""if universities are to continue to boost the economy and benefit communities, they need the right support from government.

""this means securing the best brexit deal and changing the immigration system to one that it is proportionate and welcoming to genuine international students and staff.â

a department for education spokesperson said: âeu and international students, staff and researchers make an important contribution to our higher education sector and we want that to continue.

""the uk has a long established system that supports and attracts the brightest minds, at all stages of their career, and the government will seek to secure the best deal for universities and their staff when negotiations for exiting the eu begin.

âthe uk remains one of the most popular destinations for students globally and we want this to continue, which is why there are no plans to cap the number of international students who can come to study in the uk.â

        true story. involving a guy called lucius, friend of a friend, and former professor of english. he had parked his car outside a convenience store in princeton. as you do. and a stick-up happened to be taking place inside that same convenience store. as it will in princeton, from time to time. and, almost predictably, the gunman comes running out and leaps into the back of luciusâ car, holds a gun to his head, and screams, as is normal in these circumstances, âdrive or iâll blow your fuckinâ brains out!â.â 

if it was me, i would be putting my foot down and driving away at top speed. fast and furious. however, lucius was no ordinary man. for one thing he was 90-something. for another he was, although just about fit enough to drive, afflicted with several painful and long-term ailments of the kind 90-year-olds are prone to. and thus spent half his time in and out of hospital, getting treatment, none of it pleasant. so, having briefly reflected on his options, he turns to the gunman and says, âgo on then, shoot me. you'll be doing me a favour.â the robber was so flummoxed by his composure that he ran off and was duly arrested.

the overriding feeling of both lucius and his would-be passenger was one of disappointment in the performance of the other. which i was reminded of recently when west ham went down 5-0 in the fa cup (against manchester city). we can now, as they say, âconcentrate on the leagueâ. the great boast of west ham fans is that they have far and away the saddest song in football: iâm forever blowing bubbles, true, but this is the crucial point, they only ever nearly reach the sky and then âlike my dreams they fade and dieâ. and, as if to rub it in a bit more, âfortuneâs always hidingâ. on the other hand, iâm not in favour of commissioning a more upbeat song.

i remember that back in the 1998 world cup in france, when france, contrary to expectation, beat brazil 3-0 in the final, the complaint of one rather literate parisian in the pages of le monde was that the best the triumphant french fans could come up with was tooting their horns and leaning out of car windows, yelling, âon a gagnã©!â (we won). relatively uninspired. i think he would have preferred the west ham theme tune, more on the melancholy wavelength of a grand french tradition.

a chã¢teau. a bedroom where your lover awaits. an illicit nocturnal rendezvous. the consummation of a romance. what more could you possibly ask for? not a thing. all your desires have been fulfilled. satisfaction achieved. the end. except not if you are julien sorel, virgin and apprentice priest. not if you are in a novel by the great 19th-century novelist stendhal, as opposed to a mills & boon. he stumbles out of that bedroom âsome hours laterâ, muttering a phrase that recurs in stendhalâs writing generally with all the regularity of a mournful cathedral bell: âis that all it is?â (ânâest-ce que ã§a?â) he has now officially had everything he ever wished for and he canât understand what all the fuss is about. and itâs more than a passing post-coital mood. julien swings around from an ardent romantic into an anti-romantic anti-hero. he suffers, in a word, like lucius, the gun-toting robber, and like west ham, the misfiring football team, from disappointment. he is disappointed even with fulfilment.

emma stone in la la land, where purist jazz counterpoints the dream factory

stendhal, who trekked back from moscow in the snow with napoleon in 1812, leaving most of a 500,000-strong grande armã©e frozen in the beresina or sliced up by cossacks, knew all about bubbles fading and dying. but there is a further element to the art of life, the necessary complement to disappointment. it is there in the fate of julien sorel in the final pages of the red and the black, and it is echoed in the fate of meursault at the end of camusâ the outsider, when he looks forward to the guillotine and fully expects to hear âcries of hatredâ from the spectators. it is a combination that occurs, right now, in a more musical vein, in la la land, where purist jazz counterpoints the dream factory. and it explains why, for example, the rolling stonesâ album of blues songs has been so ironically successful. the blues = disappointment + stoicism.

i was recently reminded of one of the best examples of stoicism, beyond sorel and meursault and ryan gosling, when i was asked to consider writing a book about ted deerhurst, one of our great unsung british heroes. ted (aka viscount edward george william omar coventry) was a surfer who yearned to become world champion. he represented great britain as an amateur and was inevitably drawn as a pro to hawaii, the ultimate arena, the coliseum of epic waves.

he may not have made it right to the top (i suppose he was the surfing equivalent of west ham, destined for mid-table mediocrity), but he was the only surfer i knew who was capable of re-enacting a battle from the second world war on the beach at pipeline, using miniature toy soldiers and tanks, while waiting for his heat. he rode a board bearing the emblem of a sword and the word âexcaliburâ, which was also the name of the charity he set up to enable under-privileged and disabled kids to go surfing. i remember his famous last words when, having registered in the end-of-year rankings at the royal hawaiian hotel at 235th in the world, he resolved to go and give snowboarding a whirl instead: âat least you canât drown up a mountain.â naturally he spent the next six months in hospital.

ted supplemented his quest for the perfect wave with a concept of âthe perfect womanâ. it was probably because i had expressed some scepticism on the subject that he phoned me up from hawaii in the middle of the night, transferring charges, to tell me that he had found her. and he eventually introduced me to lola as well, at the club in downtown honolulu where she worked as a pole-dancer. âshe really does love me,â ted assured me, stuffing a $20 note in her g-string. and he was only forced to cool off finally, and head for the mountains, when visited at his home by a couple of men in suits (a rarity in hawaii) and armed with shotguns (not quite so rare). they were the henchmen of a drug baron who also claimed to be lolaâs boyfriend and wished to inquire how he would feel about surfing with only one leg.

epictetus urges us to see no distinction between 'is' and 'ought'

in terms of surfing stoicism, i have to take my hat off to bethany hamilton, who surfed with only one arm, her right one, since a shark had chomped off the left one when she was only 13. i paddled out with her in maui and she was still a way better surfer than i ever was with two arms. but my real education in hawaii came from a woman in a cafã© on oahu who asked me where i came from. âyouâre lucky,â she said. âhow do you work that out?â i said, still intoxicated by giant waves and palm trees, few and far-between on the mean streets of the east end. âat least in england,â she replied, ânobody minds if youâre miserable.â she turned out to be a psychiatrist specialising in depression. âha!â i said, or something similar, finding it hard to credit her story.

so she actually took me to her clinic on the island and explained that just as many people are depressed in hawaii as anywhere else on the planet but that because they were living in âparadiseâ, they felt guilty about it on top. and since they were technically living in america, if they were broke too, then they were thrice screwed. contrary to karl marx, the point about psychiatry, she argued, was not to improve the world but only the way you interpret it.

which is where stoicism comes in. i believe it was founded, as a branch of philosophy, by zeno of citium (or cyprus), but the best formulation that i know of is in the brilliant and provocative enchiridion by epictetus, who was crippled, and lived in the first century ad, in rome and greece. he recommends ways of coping with every kind of death and disaster you can imagine. but the more minor example of everyday disappointment that sticks in my mind is this one. say your servant had just dropped your favourite vase (a classic greek vase, decorated with pan, a flute, and semi-naked nymphs) on to your stone floor and it has shattered into a thousand pieces. do you crack up and give your servant a good kicking? answer, no, says epictetus. you say to yourself: âthe vase is not broken, it has only been restored.â returned, in other words, to its pre-vaselike state. so nothing has been lost. the vase itself was only a temporary anomaly. so too, all human life, condemned to entropy.

stoicism is the ultimate expression of philosophical resignation and is completely admirable. but of course it contains its own contradiction since it expresses dissatisfaction with dissatisfaction. it is impossible to be stoical all the time. in the end you want to fix things and change the world, even if itâs only trying to stick that vase back together again or make a new one. such is negentropy, a protest against the tendency of everything to fall apart.

stoical gene kelly: taking pleasure from the rain

in modern literary terms, the best case of the stoic who finally revolts is jack reacher. on a rooftop in madrid, lee child, reacherâs creator, says âphilosophically, reacher is a stoic. stoicism is about all he has in the way of philosophy.â he can put up with unbelievable amounts of pain without moaning. he disdains paracetamol and aspirin. he can re-set his own broken nose and tape it up with duct-tape. but is he really a stoic?

epictetus urges us to see no distinction between an âisâ and an âoughtâ. everything right now (no matter how bad) is just the way it ought to be. nothing (tsunamis, volcanoes erupting, shipwrecks, brexit, trump or crashing out of the fa cup) is that big of a deal, you say to yourself. thus easing the pain and attaining the serene calm of ataraxia. very cool. but hard to keep up.â 

question: if the lone woman on the late-night metro in paris is getting mugged or groped by some drunk, do you just sit there and lift up your copy of lâequipe and concentrate on the dayâs news? the reacher response is an ascending scale, from indifference to a sense of injustice, to indignation and righteous fury. sometimes a broken jug just cries out for fixing.

lee child puts down his fork and says: âstoicism used to mean something like âgo with the flowâ. it doesnât sound much like reacher, does it? he hates the flow.â child had second thoughts: âstoicism used to mean something like âgo with the flowâ. it doesnât sound much like reacher, does it? he hates the flow.ââ

        london could be about to witness its biggest stock exchange listing in around six years.

 

european warehouse company logicor, which is valued at a bumper â£11bn and currently owned by the private equity giant blackstone, is aiming to go public on the cityâs stock exchange some time during the first six months of this year, according to city am.

 

if successful, the deal would be the biggest initial public offering in london since commodity giant glencore went public in 2011, at a valuation of â£36bn. it would also likely inject fresh energy into the market for uk listings, which has endured a rollercoaster ride since juneâs shock brexitâ vote, exacerbated by political uncertainty in the us.

several planned stock market listings were put on hold or scrapped at the end of last year. companies floating in the uk raised just â£3.5bn in 2016, less than half the â£7.6bn the previous year, london stock exchange data shows.

city am reported on friday that logicor owner blackstone could also consider a sale or a listing elsewhere, but a london float is understood to be the most likely outcome.

 

a large deal could revive what has been a somewhat lacklustre market and some experts see positive signs for the year ahead.

 

the number of international companies seeking a listing is increasing, according to lucy tarleton, a director in the capital markets team at pwc.

once called 'boris buses' named after his the previous mayor, every bus would cost around â£350,000 each, or around â£50,000 more than an ordinary bus.

but the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

                chancellor philip hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor george osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the ukâs brexit vote.

in early july mr osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the uk is still âopen for businessâ despite the vote to leave the eu.
in his speech to the conservative party conference in birmingham today, mr hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

âwith trump we donât know what his policies are going to be - are they protectionist? are they pro-business? and if thereâs one thing the ipo market doesnât like is uncertainty.â

        brexit just cut the cost of that dream sports car. as long as you live in ireland.

for mercedes-benz buyers, driving on the same side of the road as the uk while using a different currency comes with a new perk. the company in ireland is reducing new car prices by 10 per cent because of brexit, a move it says is designed to support distributors after the slump in the pound made uk imports cheaper. at 14 irish dealerships, the top-of-the-range mercedes-amg gt s now costs â¬225,000 (â£196,000), saving about â¬25,000.

âlike the uk, ireland has right-hand drive, plus it has the euro,â said ashley winston, who sources cars on request across the uk from his london base. âso irish drivers are almost uniquely placed to take advantage of brexit.â

uk small business lender bucks brexit jitters with $100m funding round



irelandâs historical, economic and geographical ties with the uk have made britainâs decision to leave the european union one of its biggest ever foreign-policy challenges. any longer-term clouds over trade and border controls at least have a short-term silver lining: irish consumers are getting things a little cheaper after the pound fell 12 per cent against the euro since the june vote.

the number of used private cars imported and licensed in december more than doubled to 6,357, the irish statistics office said on thursday. they mainly come from across the irish sea before being taxed and registered.

mercedes, part of daimler, said decreasing prices across its model range was already helping sales in january. the company has been running radio adverts trying to tempt irish drivers.

ciaran allen, sales manager at mercedes-benz passenger cars in ireland said theâ price cut in âresponse to brexit ââ and the impact it was having on sales of new and used cars in ireland as a consequence of the drop in the value of sterling, which in turn has increased the level of grey imports â has had a positive impactâ.

in sligo, in the north west of ireland, car dealer kevin egan acquired the domain name brexitcars.ie immediately after the vote to exit the eu. the site says he bought his stock at the ânew, favourable sterling ratesâ and also carries warnings about buying a car across the irish border, such as the lack of after-sales care and issues around warranties.

âthereâs a perception that the uk is so much cheaper,â said mr egan, who employs 19 people after opening his own business following the closure of the dealership he worked in 2009. âthe message was: âbefore you go, ring usâ.â

even with the mercedes price cuts, itâs still more expensive to buy cars in ireland. the mercedes-amg gt s costs â£111,495 in the uk, according to the car companyâs online catalogue. in part, the difference is explained by higher tax rates in ireland, and drivers importing cars have to pay the difference.

still, the irish inquiries keep coming to mr winston in london. he said his company is preparing to deliver a â£75,000 used volvo to a client in dublin.

âi was despairing when the brexit result came through,â he said. âthen, an irish client said this is going to be great, you are going to get lots of business from us. he was right. brexit hasnât been so terrible after all.â

        the liberal democrats are celebrating stunning local council victories in both the north and south, raising the partyâs hopes that a comeback is underway.

the party triumphed in sandhill, in the labour heartland of sunderland, with a 41.5 point leap in its vote share. labour support fell by nearly 30 points.

and in gade valley, on three rivers council in hertfordshire, the libs won by more than 400 votes from the conservatives following a 24-point jump in support.

richmond shows we can make a progressive alliance to fight hard brexit



the victories follow the partyâs shock win in the richmond park parliamentary by-election last month, when sarah olney beat former conservative zac goldsmith.

and they come on the back of the lib demsâ best ever year for council by-elections in 2016, when 31 seats were gained over the 12-month period.

alastair campbell, tony blairâs former right-hand man, tweeted his reaction to the labour loss in sunderland with the single word âwhat?â.

embarrassingly for jeremy corbyn, just days ago he defended his leadership on the basis that labour was enjoying success in local council polls.

strikingly, both last nightâs town hall victories came in areas that voted leave in the eu referendum â while richmond park was firmly remain.

tim farron, the lib dem leader, said: âwe finished 2016 winning by-elections and tonight we have shown that the lib dem fightback is going from strength to strength.

âit is the liberal democrats who are standing up and representing them, we are the real opposition to this conservative brexit government.â

the lib dems are hopeful they can make a mark in the forthcoming westminster by-election in copeland, in cumbria, triggered by the resignation of a disillusioned labour mp.

the party finished a distant fourth in 2015, but is the first to have selected a candidate and the seat is next to that of mr farron.

brexit: makers of mr kipling cakes could hike prices



toblerone came under fire last year after the space between the distinctive triangles of its chocolate treats was increased. mondelez international, the company behind the product, said the change was made as a result of a rise in raw material costs in recent months.

in another chocolate tragedy, the retail prices of cadburyâs tiny chocolate frogs are scheduled to jump by 20 per cent from 25p to 30p in spring this year, according to the guardian.

a mondelez spokesperson declined to discuss specific brands but confirmed there would be ""selective"" price increases across its range despite the american multi-nation confectionery giant reporting profits of $548m (â£450m) in its last three-month financial period.

a spokesman said: âincreasing prices is always a last resort, but to ensure we can keep peopleâs favourite brands on shelf and look after the 4,500 people we employ in the uk, we are having to make some selective price increases across our range.â

mondelez, which bought cadbury in 2010, said rising commodity costs combined with the slump in the value of the pound since the uk voted to leave the eu meant its products were becoming more expensive to make.

âit is well reported that food and drink manufacturers have been experiencing increasing commodity costs for some time which, coupled with recent foreign exchange pressures, are making food products more expensive to make. for example, the price of cocoa, which we import into the uk, is up by over 50 per cent since 2013,â a spokesperson for the company said.

chocolate fans have been digesting the news on twitter.

twitter user, eleanor rosenbach,â  said: âenough is enough brexit. when will your attacks on all that we hold.â

another one added: âthe price of a #freddo will soon be 30p. you thought 2016 was savage, 2017 is off to a great startâ

the confectionery industry has a history of âshrinkflationâ, where prices remain the same as portion sizes get smaller, but conditions this year have put particular pressure on chocolatiers.

a helpful âmilk chocolate indexâ from analysts at mintec last november showed the combined price of key ingredients â cocoa butter, cocoa powder, whey, sugar and whole milk powder â is up almost 30 per cent this year.

several companies including premier foods, the maker of mr kipling cakes and bisto gravy, clothing retailer next andâ  mars, which owns the maltesers brand said products will either go up in price or becoming smaller in 2017 due to rising commodity costs coupled with foreign exchange pressures.

        european courts will continue to ""dish out judgments"" to the uk if it opts for a transitional deal after brexit, an influential eu leader has warned.

the comments from malta's prime minister joseph muscat, whose government holds the rotating presidency of the eu for the first half of this year, come after theresa may pledged to take the uk out of the jurisdiction of the european court.

it comes afterâ the independent revealed in december that ministers are resigned to european judges taking decisions in british cases for years to come.

the maltese premier made clear that any transition trade arrangements, which could last well into the 2020s, would see european institutions retain the upper hand.

""an essential part of those transitional arrangements will be the governing institutions of that period,"" he said, according to the times.

theresa may will make her long-awaited brexit speech next week



""it is pretty clear to me that the institutions should be the european institutions.

""so it is not a transition period where british institutions take over, but it is a transition period where the european court of justice is still in charge of dishing out judgments.""

malta's finance minister edward scicluna said he believed the prime minister would ""blink first"" as pressure grew during exit negotiations.

ms may, who will deliver a key-note brexit address on tuesday, told last autumn's tory conference: ""we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice.""

the prime minister will be under pressure to use next week's speech to spell out a broader strategy ahead of triggering formal divorce negotiations, which she has promised by april.

reports have suggested ms may will commit to pulling out of the single market if the european union fails to make concessions on the free movement of its citizens, although they have been dismissed as speculation.

foreign secretary boris johnson and brexit secretary david davis are contributing to the content of the address, which opposition parties hope will end months of secrecy over the government's exit plans.

meanwhile, the supreme court is expected to rule this month on whether ms may has the authority to invoke article 50 without the prior consent of parliament.

if the court rules against the government, ministers will have to prepare legislation and pass it through the commons and the lords before the end of march to stick to ms may's brexit timetable.

ms may's official spokeswoman said: ""she will be making a speech on tuesday, setting out more on our approach to brexit, as part of preparing for the negotiations and in line with our approach for global britain and continuing to be an outward-looking nation.""

        theresa may will finally lift the lid on her brexit strategy next week â possibly just days before a crucial supreme court ruling on whether parliament must give its consent to leaving the eu.

a long-awaited speech â which, the prime minister promised, would reveal âmore detailsâ of her plans â will be made next tuesday, it was announced.

downing street has decided to get ahead of a likely defeat in the supreme court, which is expected to confirm thatâ mps and peers must approve the triggering of the article 50 exit clause.

senior tory mp calls on theresa may to clarify brexit position



the government is believed to have already drawn up at least two versions of a bill that could be tabled to comply with the ruling â which could come later in the week.

in the speech, the prime minister will be under pressure to finally state clearly whether she wants britain to remain in the euâs single market or customs union after brexit.

angela merkel, germanyâs chancellor, has led eu leaders who insist britain cannot enjoy favourable access to the single market if it ends free movement of people.

last weekend, ms may gave her clearest signal yet that single market exit is therefore inevitable â in order to achieve border controls â but stopped short of saying so.

even her hints were enough to send the pound to its lowest level since october, as the markets interpreted her remarks as evidence of a looming âhard brexitâ.

she said: âoften people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the eu but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the eu.

âwe are leaving. we are coming out. we are not going to be a member of the eu any longer. so the question is what is the right relationship for the uk to have with the european union when we are outside?â

fresh in the memory is the fierce criticism of sir ivan rogers, the ukâs ambassador to the eu, who condemned âmuddled thinkingâ in his explosive resignation letter.

the prime minister will also be under pressure to say whether she will seek a transition deal, to avoid the economic damage from crashing out of the eu without a fresh trade agreement.

cross-channel security and the future status of three million eu citizens in the uk are other key issues that she has been urged to address.

today, her official spokeswoman said: âshe will be making a speech on tuesday, setting out more on our approach to brexit, as part of preparing for the negotiations and in line with our approach for global britain and continuing to be an outward-looking nation.â

however, ministers have said the brexit plan â demanded by the commons in a vote last month â will not be published until february, at the earliest.

it has been suggested that the government expects to lose by seven votes to four, when the 11 supreme court judges rule on article 50.

ministers asked for early sight of the judgement, to enable âcontingency planningâ, but the court ruled that out, saying: âitâs just too sensitiveâ.â

        legislation to preserve workersââ rights after britain has left the european union will come before parliament on friday, via a new bill that would safeguard every aspect of employment legislation currently protected under eu law.

when britain leaves the european union, the government will introduce a great repeal bill, that is expected to enshrine eu laws on workersâ rights into british law, but there are concerns that the process will weaken important rights for employees.

currently, many rights, such asâ maternity pay and equal pay rights for part-time workers, are protected by the european court of justice. the concern is that the great repeal bill would protect these rights but leave them open to be amended or removed via statutory instrument, not by an act of parliament, meaning a government could alter them without a parliamentary vote.

uk's first centre for brexit studies launched in birmingham



melanie onn, the mp for great grimsby who introduced the the workersââ rights (maintenance of eu standards) bill, which will have its second reading before parliament on friday morning, said: ârights for working people in britain have been hard-won, often the result of decades of pressure from the labour movement. brexit gives the government the opportunity to undo all that work.

âmy bill would protect in the strongest form of uk legislation all workersââ rights which are derived from the european union. it will be the first test of whether the conservatives will keep to the promise theresa may made at their party conference in october last year, that workersââ rights will be maintained after brexit.â

the bill is unlikely to make it to a vote on friday morning, but labourâs shadow brexit secretary keir starmer has said it should be seen as a âgold standardââ for protecting workersâ rights after brexit.

many aspects of employment legislation have come to pass only via case law, and these too are protected by the european court of justice and so would be under threat after brexit. the bill proposes transposing all existing rights guaranteed by the ecj into british law, but not future ones.

mr starmer said: âitâs absolutely vital that leaving the eu does not lead to any reduction in workplace rights.

âthatâs why this bill is so important. it would ensure that the workplace rights millions of people rely on ââ from parental leave to rights for agency workers â are enshrined in uk law and cannot be watered down as a result of brexit.â

        birmingham city university is to launch a centre for brexit studiesâ (cbs) to foster understanding of the national impact of the ukâs decision to leave the eu.

the centre aims to promote engagement of both âleaveâ and âremainâ standpoints, while providing collaborative opportunities with businesses, professional organisations and civil society, the university said.

while many universities worldwide have penned research reports assessing brexitâs impact on politics, economics and civil society since juneâs referendum, birmingham city university is the first to dedicate an organisation to the study on the issue..

hard brexit could be 'biggest disaster' for uk universities in years



âwith the vote of the uk to leave the eu it is now crucial to gain an understanding of the complexities that brexit entails for individuals, communities, business and government, whilst clearing up misconceptions around its impact,â said alex de ruyter, research director at birmingham city universityâs business school.

the cbs plans to conduct research into the expected impact of brexitâ on national and regional issues, ranging from business and trade, national security, hate crime and radicalisation and climate change, the university added in a statement.

while the centreâs research will primarily be undertaken by the universityâs faculty and students, it will open some of its research and conferences to the public. neither the size of the centre, nor the names and nationalities of the faculty and students, remain clear at this point.

the news of cbsâ establishment comes after a panel of university vice-chancellors warned on wednesday that a âhard brexitâ, or a uk decision to quit the single market, could be âthe biggest disaster for the universities sector in many yearsâ.â

the academics said that concerns over anti-immigration sentiments in the uk and a falling pound would dissuade students from applying for places at their institutions.â 

catherine barnard, an eu law professor at the university of cambridge, noted that applications for undergraduate places from eu students had already fallen by 14 percent this year.

alex de ruyter, director at bcuâs business school, said the centre would focus in particular at the impact of the vote on birmingham and the surrounding area. the city voted narrowly in favour of leave in the referendum, with 22 of its 40 council wards voting for brexit.

the university will mark cbsâ official launch with a free conference in birminghamâs hotel la tour on 26 january.

        british peer-to-peer lenders were bracing for disaster when the uk voted to quit the european union on 23 june. maybe they neednât have worried.

funding circle, the biggest online lender for small businesses in the uk, has raised $100m (â£81m) in equity funding, it said in a statement on thursday. accel partners, the palo alto, california-based venture capital firm, led the round, which included index ventures, union square ventures, and temasek holdings, singaporeâs state-owned investment company.

retail investors and borrowers have flocked to their platforms since the brexit vote with total loan volumes surging 28 per centâ to â£8.7bn, according to altfi data, a london-based research firm. funding circleâs lending has jumped by a third since the 23 june referendum.

peer to peer lending? youâd be wise not to bank on it



some analysts say the bank of englandâs decision to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent from 0.5 per cent in august prompted retail investors to seek profits in peer-to-peer loans that were, on average, returning about 5 per cent. others say investors paused in the months leading up to the vote and now are piling back into the space because the british economy has avoided a recession many economists predicted.

âitâs probably a combination of things,â said cormac leech, a london-based principal at victory park capital advisors, a private-equity firm in chicago that invests in peer-to-peer loans. âgrowth has been stronger than expected, investors are hunting for yield, and thereâs a bounce-back from earlier in the year.â

in november, funding circle became the first online lender to arrange more than â£100m in loans in a single month. the startup, which also operates platforms in the us, germany, the netherlands, and spain, said today that its uk operations had positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the fourth quarter. zopa, the largest online lender to consumers in the uk, also broke into the black on that basis late last year.

	funding circle boosted by peer-to-peer as revenue rockets 177%



funding circleâs round is the biggest in the uk since 2015. it bucks a drop in fintech investing in europe and north america as startups morph into more mature businesses.

in the third quarter, venture investing in british fintech firms skidded 42 per cent from the year-earlier period to â£64m, according to cb insights, a new york-based research firm.

the deal comes as funding circle and its ilk face a crackdown by the financial conduct authority. in december, the british regulator issued a report finding that the industry fell short of providing fair and transparent offerings to investors. fca chief executive andrew bailey said the industry is growing so rapidly that platforms may be too complicated for retail investors to understand. this year, it may work with parliament to implement new industry rules.

even so, harry nelis, a partner at accel who led the funding round, said funding circle is in a position to deliver what venture capitalists crave ââ the ability to grow significantly. the firm dominates online lending for small companies in the uk, a market that topped â£5.6bn in the third quarter. and chief executive samir desai is making a push in the us market, which topped $417bn in october 2016.

                london mayor sadiq khan has ended any hopes to purchase new routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on london's transport budget.

once called 'boris buses' named after his the previous mayor, every bus would cost around â£350,000 each, or around â£50,000 more than an ordinary bus.

but the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

                britain's index of leading shares slipped on wednesday from record highs reached in the previous session, partly reflecting currency moves which weighed on some of its global companies

the blue-chip ftse 100 equity index, which hit a record high of 7,129.83 points on tuesday, fell 0.5 percent to 7,038.22 points. the ftse 250 mid-cap index fell 0.4 percent but also remained near record highs reached this month.

the dollar dipped while sterling rebounded a touch from a brutal sell-off this month, as british prime minister theresa may's offer to give lawmakers some scrutiny of the process behind britain's plans to leave the european union calmed market fears of a ""hard brexit"".

                      philip hammond ditches george osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - monday october 3                  
        
                chancellor philip hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor george osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the ukâs brexit vote.

in early july mr osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the uk is still âopen for businessâ despite the vote to leave the eu.
in his speech to the conservative party conference in birmingham today, mr hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

âwhat weâre looking for is the possibility of something big, and in the uk alone you could build a business with a market capitalisation worth several billion,â nelis said.

funding circle declined to disclose its valuation. the company, which has arranged more than â£2.5bn in loans since its founding in 2010, was valued at more than $1bn when it raised $150m in april 2015.

chancellorâ philip hammond said on thursday thatâ funding circleâs deal was a âvote of confidenceâ in a firm thatâs âhelping business to grow and create jobs.â

last week, the british business bank, a government-owned development bank, made â£40m available on funding circleâs platform for loans to small businesses.

        a proposed levy on skilled european union (eu)â workers has been calledâ the âmost idiotic thing to come out of a ministerâs mouth since red, white and blue brexitâ.

immigration minister robert goodwill told the lords eu home affairs committee the governmentâ were considering introducing a â£1,000 âimmigration skills chargeâ for every eu citizen employed by a british company.â 

he said a similar charge was due to come into force for non-eu workersâ in aprilâ and theyâ wereâ studying the idea of extending it to skilled eu workers.â 

but the liberal democrats, who fiercely oppose leaving the union, said the idea was the âmost idiotic thing since red, white and blue brexitâ.

the party'sâ shadow business secretary don foster said: ""be under no illusions, this plan would kill off british businesses. the conservatives used to represent business interests, they have now sacrificed them on the altar of populism. â 

âiâve yet to meet a single business who would hire from abroad if they could find the skills they need here. the choice they are making is because of their demand to grow, not to abandon british workers.""

he added:â âinstead of pandering to anti-immigrant sentiment, the government should be investing in schools, further education and training to ensure british citizens have the skills british business desperately needs.â

the institute ofâ directors (iod)â warned against the move. although employers accepted that immigration policy would change after brexit the levy would âhit businesses who are dependent on skills from abroadâ, it said.â â

theresa may won't be getting a 'red, white and blue brexit'



under a previous scheme, fruit and vegetable growers were allowed to employ bulgarians and romanians for up to six months at a time, with an annual quota of 21,250.

the programme closed when restrictions on migrants from the two countries were lifted at the start of 2014.

at the end of last year, prime minister theresa may was ridiculed for claiming she wanted a âred, white and blue brexitâ when asked if she was leaning towards hard or soft brexit.â 

ms may was aiming to provoke a sense of national pride but lib dem leader tim farron dismissed it as âjingoistic claptrapâ.

        leaving the single market as well as the european union would be a âdisasterâ for british universities, leading academics have warned.

a panel of university vice-chancellors told the education select committee that universities were already feeling the consequences of the vote to leave the european union, particularly through the falling pound discouraging foreign academics to come to the uk to work. at cambridge university, applications from other eu countries have already dropped by 14 per cent.

alistair fitt, vice-chancellor of oxford brookes university, said: ""it would probably be the biggest disaster for the universities sector in many years.""

john latham, vice-chancellor of coventry university, said it would make british universities ""extremely uncompetitive"".

british rule would place northern ireland at âmercy of hard brexit'



catharine barnard, eu law professor at the university of cambridge, said: ""it promptly cuts off the flow of excellent people who are coming at the moment.""

prof barnard said there had already been a drop in eu student applications.

""this year we have seen at cambridge a 14% reduction in the number of applications from the european union at undergraduate level, although i should say the number of applications from eu students at postgraduate level are up,"" she said.

""in respect of those who have declined an offer from cambridge at postgraduate level, we have put a question in the so-called decliners survey to say 'what was it that dissuaded you from coming?'

""those who answered the question offered a range of factors from a concern about anti-immigrant sentiment to devaluation of the pound and the fact that their scholarships would be worth less, although obviously not in the uk, and uncertainty over future research collaboration.""

prof fitt told mps the uk does not ""get as much out"" of some research and innovation funding pots as it puts in.

he said: ""european structural funding is very important for the uk but the uk, i believe, doesn't get as much out of it as they put in.

""structural funding can also come with quite a few strings attached, can come with quite a few risks and can be quite hard to manage.

""so, if we were able to replace the amount of structural funding with our own funds, that's a real opportunity that we could not only retain all that's best in that system, but actually make it an even better system.""

alastair buchan, head of brexit strategy at the university of oxford, said the sector had been hit when britain joined the eu.

he said: ""one of the things that we did lose was that nice and easy flow of clinicians and clinician science from canada, the us, australia, new zealand and south africa.

postgraduates from eu countries working in the uk are already considering moving abroad as the status of their right to remain in the uk after brexit is not yet certain.

dr corbett told mps: ""i think that the issue we're talking about here is actually one which requires government intervention and it requires it before the negotiations start.

employersâ groups and pro-eu politicians spoke out against the idea after it was floated by the immigration minister, one branding it âidioticâ.

the âimmigration skills levyâ â already being introduced for staff from the rest of the world â could be extended to the eu, robert goodwill said.

uk employers may have to pay a â£1,000-a-year fee per eu skilled worker



but, within hours, faced with the fierce criticism, downing street insisted the levy would not be brought in.

theresa mayâs spokeswoman said: âhe seems to have been misinterpreted and his comments taken out of context.

âwhat he said was there are a number of things that some people may suggest could be the way forward.

âat no point did he say itâs on the agenda. and it is not on the governmentâs agenda,â she told a regular westminster briefing.

earlier, seamus nevin, of the institute of directors, said: âcharging â£1,000 for each eu worker would hit businesses who are dependent on skills from abroad.

âthe uk needs these companies to do well if we are to make a success of brexit. we urge the government to reconsider this proposal.â

and ufi ibrahim, of the british hospitality association,â described the proposal as âvery worrying for the hospitality and tourism industry.

âthe ministerâs suggestion would increase the costs for hospitality and tourism businesses and would lead to higher prices for consumers,â he added.

prominent conservative backbencher anna soubry said: âthis would be a tax on successful businesses.â

and don foster, for the liberal democrats, said: âthis is the most idiotic thing to come out of a ministerâs mouth since âred white and blue brexitâ.â

the criticism came after mr goodwill said the brexit result showed voters believed that companies are relying too much on migrants from outside britain.

they had made clear that not enough was being done to ensure that âthe skills are available from our own peopleâ, he told a house of lords inquiry.

mr goodwill said an apprenticeship levy, later this year, would help the government meet its commitment to train more than three million more apprentices by 2020.

and he added: âin april this year, we are also bringing in the immigration skills charge for non-eea skilled workers.

âif you want to recruit an indian computer programmer on a four-year contract, on top of the existing visa charges and the resident labour market test, there will be a fee of â£1,000 per year.

âso, for a four-year contract that employer will need to pay a â£4,000 immigration skills charge.

âthat is something that currently applies to non-eu and it has been suggested to us that could be applied to eu.â

the rethink comes after an earlier home office plan â to force businesses to reveal how many foreign staff they employ â was also abandoned quickly, following widespread condemnation.

        just when you thought that britain couldnât get any more stupid, immigration minister robert goodwill (surely a misnomer that) has suggested that companies could be charged a â£1,000 âskills levyâ for hiring workers from the continent.â 

firms that employ from outside the eu will already face this extra cost from april. mr goodwill has, however, told a house of lords committee that it could extended to cover the eu after the brexit process is complete (so not until something like 2050 but weâll set that aside for now).â

uk employers may have to pay a â£1,000-a-year fee per eu skilled worker



even as it stands, the measure could deprive britons of good jobs rather than helping them to fill skilled roles.

companies need to know that they can hire the people with the skills they need. if they canât get them from the domestic labour market, they need to know that they can import them.â if they canât do that - or if it is made too expensive - they will go elsewhere.

the uk could suffer a net reduction in jobs as a result of the levy because companies that top up with overseas staffâ still employâ a majority of uk workers in their uk operations. if it pushes firms out, the uk will lose those jobs.â 

the measure is therefore a prime example of the government cutting off the countryâs nose to spite its face. however, the impact shouldâ be relatively modest as things stand. employers can still hire from across an entire continent after all.

if they can no longer do that after brexit, the chances of them â giving up on this country as a bad job will be very much greater.â 

the levy could very easily end up with theâ governmentâ poking one of the nation'sâ eyes out as well as cutting that nose off.â

this country's skills problem is by no means just the fault of the corporate sector.â it is true that companies should invest more in training. but no more so than should the government, which is primarily at fault for the nation's under skilled workforce, and which has to hire from overseas to ensure certain rather important public services don't fall flat on their faces. â 

if you want evidence for that, just take a trip down to any a&e in any large city. there you will found doctors and nurses from all over the world. the reason they are desperately needed is the uk government simply hasnât trained enough of its own. it is also failing to keep hold of enough of those it does train.

this is not a problem that is limited to the nhs. it affects other parts of the public sector too. if there is any organisation that should be charged a skills levy it is the uk government.â 

that, of course, would be self defeating. but no more so than charging the corporate sector.â

                london mayor sadiq khan has ended any hopes to purchase new routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on london's transport budget.

but the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

                the british pound has suffered a sudden collapse hitting a new 31-year low against the us dollar in mysterious circumstances, sparking market chaos in âinsaneâ early trading.

                chancellor philip hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor george osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the ukâs brexit vote.

in early july mr osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the uk is still âopen for businessâ despite the vote to leave the eu.
in his speech to the conservative party conference in birmingham today, mr hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

the cbi, and other business groups, not to mention the tuc, have been banging on about what has become known as âthe skills gapâ for years now to little discernible effect. their complaints have been greeted with a tin ear in westminster and whitehall.â 

now ministers have woken up to the problem they have chosen to tackle it not by working with businesses and unions on a sensible plan that would involve investment, and perhaps incentives, but with a breathtakingly cynical new tax in an attempt to burnish its britain first credentials.â 

this tax wonât result in any more skilled british workers. it will simply result in fewerâ british workers.â

        the uk's bluechip stock index has chalked up a fresh record close every day of the year so far, but if it weren't for the tumbling pound, the benchmark's trajectory would be quite unremarkable.â 

on wednesday, the ftse 100 ended the session up 0.2â per cent, continuing its longest winning streak in years and extending its lengthiest run of record-breaking days ever.

pound sterling hits a new 31-year low against the dollar



it's risen close to 2 per centâ so far in 2017, extending a ferocious rally since the shock june brexit vote triggered a dramatic slump in the pound. over that period, it's one of europe's best performing indexes.

but the ftse 100 is priced in pound sterling, which means that the rally itself cannot be attributed to the performance of the individual companies in it.

because of the pound's nose-dive, the income that internationally-exposed companies generate overseas becomes worth more when brought back home.

around two thirds of ftse 100 revenue is generated overseas.

according to chris beauchamp, a senior market analyst at spread betting company ig, the ftse 100 actually dropped more than 4 per centâ last year when calculated in us dollar terms.

he says that it's 25 per centâ off its 2014 high and is currently back at levels last seen in october.â 

while the index may be up around 22 per centâ in sterling terms since the brexit vote, it's only gained around 12 per centâ when calculated in dollar terms, according to beauchamp.â 

""in dollar terms, the ftse 100 is one of the worst performing of the major indices over the past year,"" says matthew tillett, uk equities portfolio manager at allianz global investors.â

he says that the ftse 100's relative underperformance over the longer term is because of how it has become dominated by certain sectors and stocks.â 

oil and gas companies, which in recent years have been sent on a rollercoaster ride as a result of volatility in commodity prices, account for around 15 per centâ of the market capitalisation of the whole index meaning that moves in those stocks will have a disproportionately high impact on the whole index.

bank stocks, which also tend to underperform when volatility in markets rises, make up around 13 per centâ of the whole indexes capitalisation.

        a hard brexit could cause the âbiggest disasterâ in higher education for many years, top academics have warned.

at a public hearing in oxford, university vice-chancellors appeared in front of the education select committee to discuss the potential effects that britain's departure from the eu might have on the industry.

hostility towards immigrants, devaluation of the pound and uncertainty over research projects have all deterred postgraduates from heading to the uk, the board was told.

brexit could push uk universities 'off a cliff edge', report warns



presenting evidence to the committee, industry experts said while britainâs departure from the eu could provide new opportunities to improve research funding and international collaboration, a so-called hard brexit would be damaging for the sector.

alistair fitt, vice-chancellor of oxford brookes university told the hearing that brexit âwould probably be the biggest disaster for the university sector in many yearsâ.

john latham, vice-chancellor of coventry university, said it would make british universities âextremely uncompetitiveâ.

catharine barnard, eu law professor at the university of cambridge, added: âit promptly cuts off the flow of excellent people who are coming at the moment.â

the hearing follows months of concern from top academics and education leaders, who argue the reputation of britain as a hub for quality research and higher education courses could be damaged irrevocably as a result of the referendum vote.

speaking at pembroke college on wednesday, vice-chancellors emphasised that reassurances were yet to be made from the government over the future of funding for university research, as much of this comes from the eu.

concerns were also raised over early indications that the number of prospective eu students choosing to study in the uk might fall as a result of brexit â a loss that could cost the uk economy more than â£690m per year.

applications from across the european union have already dropped by 14 per cent at cambridge university for undergraduate courses alone, mps were told.

neil carmichael mp, chair of the education committee led the hearing at pembroke college, oxford

speaking to the committee, professor barnard said: âthis year we have seen at cambridge a 14 per cent reduction in the number of applications from the european union at undergraduate level, although i should say the number of applications from eu students at postgraduate level are up.

âin respect of those who have declined an offer from cambridge at postgraduate level, we have put a question in the so-called decliners survey to say 'what was it that dissuaded you from coming?'

âthose who answered the question offered a range of factors from a concern about anti-immigrant sentiment to devaluation of the pound and the fact that their scholarships would be worth less, although obviously not in the uk, and uncertainty over future research collaboration.â

written evidence published by the house of commons education committee in recent weeks highlighted concerns from 190 individual groups within the sector, following an inquiry into the impact of brexit.



  

theresa may denies 'muddled thinking' over brexit

cambridge universityâs submission warned thatâ brexit could push the reputation of uk universities off a âcliff edgeâ, leading to âserious repercussionsâ should academics be denied free movement and required to apply for visas.â 

at the hearing, prof fitt pointed out that the uk does not necessarily win from eu research and innovation funding pots it contributes to.

he said: âeuropean structural funding is very important for the uk but the uk, i believe, doesn't get as much out of it as they put in.

âstructural funding can also come with quite a few strings attached, can come with quite a few risks and can be quite hard to manage.

âso, if we were able to replace the amount of structural funding with our own funds, that's a real opportunity that we could not only retain all that's best in that system, but actually make it an even better system.â

alastair buchan, head of brexit strategy at the university of oxford, said the sector had been hit when britain joined the eu.

he said: âone of the things that we did lose was that nice and easy flow of clinicians and clinician science from canada, the us, australia, new zealand and south africa.

âwe had really good collaborations, which hopefully in this brexit climate might be reinvented, because that movement of english-speaking medicine was actually a casualty of joining europe.â

oxford is setting up a brexit observatory to collect data on the impact of quitting the eu, he said.

engineering professors' council president stephanie haywood said britain would still need to employ thousands of engineers from europe to fill the gap of 40,000 graduate staff in the industry.

âwe're doing lots of things to try to encourage more people to take up physics and stem subjects, we're trying to get more women into engineering, but i don't see these things being very quick fixes and i think it's going to be very difficult to fill the gap other than by recruiting engineers from overseas, and that includes the eu.â

prof haywood also pointed out that only 30 per cent of phd students in engineering are british and the industry is âheavily reliantâ on postgraduates filling high-end jobs.

the uncertainty over the status of eu nationals post-brexit is causing many postgraduates to consider moving abroad, whether they are from europe or have spouses from the continent, she said.

during a second witness panel focusing on freedom of movement of staff and impact on teaching, research and university reputation, anne corbett, an associate at lse enterprise, called on ministers to take action to halt any potential âbrain drainâ.

dr corbett told mps: âi think that the issue we're talking about here is actually one which requires government intervention and it requires it before the negotiations start.

âi would say that were the government to come out of its kind of purdah, or whatever it's called, and say that from the start it would be creating a much more positive climate, to assure that eu citizens here were safe, which in the end is helpful all round.â

        chancellor philip hammond has urged german politicians to collaborate with the uk in the upcoming brexit negotiations, warning the countryâs top chief executives and lawmakers that âa lot is at stakeâ.

he said that the two nations combined have been responsible for more than half the economic growth and three quarters of the employment growth in the eu since 2010, thanks to the âpolicies and philosophies that guide the economic management of our two countriesâ.

mr hammond said: â âi understand germany will approach the challenge with the priority of protecting the integrity and unity of the eu. but this does not have to be a negative sum game. a lot is at stake,â hammond said.

the chancellor was speaking at the annual die welt economic summit, an event that brings together business leaders and politicians in a closed-door setting.

âthe uk government is clear that a strong and successful eu and a strong and stable euro are very much in the ukâs interests and are a key objective for us in the forthcoming negotiations,â he said.â 

âwe will not do anything that would undermine the eu or risk its unravelling.â

he added: âthe referendum decision is irreversible. people like me who believed that it was better to remain inside the eu and to campaign for reform within, have moved on. the debate is now about what kind of brexit.â

the chancellorâs comments come as sterling slid to its lowest level since october this week after prime minister theresa â mayâs in a tv interview on sunday said that there was no prospect of britain keeping âbitsâ of eu membership, hinting at the inevitability of a so-called hard brexit.

that prompted german chancellor angela merkel to repeat her insistence that britain could not expect to âcherry pickâ its economic relations with the rest of the eu while ditching freedom of movement.

last october, the president of the european council, warned britain would have has to choose between a â hard brexit or no brexit at allâ dismissing one of the key claims of the leave campaign that the uk could âhave its cake and eat itâ.

        the european union is at greater risk than the uk if the two parties are unable to agree a financial transition phase for the city of london after brexit in 2019, the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, has warned.

giving evidence to the treasury select committee, mr carney stressed again that it would be ""welcome"" and ""highly advisable"" for uk-based financial firms that do business with continental europe to receive transition arrangements so they do not lose access abruptly in two years' time.

london could lose 'more than 200,000 jobs amid brexit uncertainty'



âif there is not such a transition put in place, in our view it will have consequences. we will work to mitigate those consequences as much as possible,â he added.

but he stressed that if this did not happen the greater financial stability risk lay with european states, rather than the uk.

âi'm not saying there are not financial stability risks to the uk - and there are economic risks to the uk - but there are greater financial stability risks on the continent in the short term for the transition than there are for the uk,â he said.

the governor stressed the reliance of european households, governments, corporations and banks on the city.â 

âif you rely on a jurisdiction for half of your lending [and] half of your securities transactions you should think very carefully about transition from where you are today to where you will be tomorrow,â he said.



  

bank of england on brexit

the fear in the city is that the uk will leave the single market, potentially meaning uk-based financial firms will suddenly no longer be able to sell services to continental customers.

the uk-based derivative clearing operations are also thought likely to be required to move to mainland europe after brexit.

the chief executive of the london stock exchange warned on tuesdayâ that the uk's vote to leave the eu poses a risk to the global financial system and could cost the city of london up to 230,000 jobs if the government fails to provide a clear plan for post-brexit operations.

asked about the possibility of a regulatory ""equivalence"" regime for the city of london in the wake of brexit, which could allow financial business to continue uninterrupted, mr carney stressed that ""we don't want to be a rule taker as an authority"" and for the bank of england to be required to merely ""cut and paste"" financial rules made in brussels and frankfurt.â

                a rise in global income inequality, that already helped spur the brexit vote and donald trumpâs election victory, are expected to shape world developments over the next decade, according to the world economic forum.

for a report published ahead of its annual summit in davos next week, the wef surveyed 750 risk experts and found that rising income and wealth disparity were cited as the most important trends in determining global developments over the next 10 years.

                london mayor sadiq khan has ended any hopes to purchase new routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on london's transport budget.

but the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

                chancellor philip hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor george osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the ukâs brexit vote.

in early july mr osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the uk is still âopen for businessâ despite the vote to leave the eu.
in his speech to the conservative party conference in birmingham today, mr hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

asked whether brexit was still the biggest single risk to the financial system, the governor said ""strictly speaking the view of the [financial policy] committee is 'no' "".

âthe scale of immediate risks around brexit have gone downâ he said, while stressing that they were still ""elevated"".

the governor was asked about the recent suggestion by his chief economist andy haldane that the bank had had a ""michael fish moment"" when it failed to anticipate the 2008 financial crisis and also in its warning of a recession in the wake of the brexit vote last year.

mr carney defended the bank on the latter front and said that it had helped to ""make the weather"" through its provision of liquidity after the referendum vote and regulatory requirements in advance of it.

âwe helped to make the weather in that we catalysed contingency plans, actions, pre-positioning of collateral, other steps with other major central banks and actual better risk management, which helped ensure that this was a smooth process, and put the country in a better place to take advantage of the opportunity,â he said.

the economic damage of brexit has been delayed, not avoided



economists had widely expected the economy to slow sharply in the wake of the brexit vote in june, with many expecting a recession.

but after a plunge in survey indicators in june, there was a bounce back and robust household consumption has powered growth for the past six months.

however james warren, research fellow at niesr, stressed that the composition of economic growth in 2016 has been ""unbalanced"".

""robust consumer spending has compensated for the weakness in other sectors. consumers face significant head winds this year and next, not least the increase in consumer price inflation that is a consequence of pass through from the depreciation of sterling in 2016,â he said.

q4 2016 forecast: no slowdown yet

niesr

âthe bank of england and the office for budget responsibility both expect gdp growth to moderate sharply this year, with both pencilling in growth of 1.4 per cent.

niesr itself also expects growth in 2017 to fall to 1.4 per cent and says there are ""downside risks"" due to the uncertainty that could follow theresa may's invoking of article 50, which will officially start the two-year brexit divorce proceedings.

niesr has also projectedâ consumer price inflation to jump to 3.8 per cent next year, from 1.2 per cent now and for employment to jump to 5.6 per cent, from below 5 per cent currently.

        employers would have to pay a â£1,000-a-year fee for every eu skilled worker they bring in after brexit, under plans being considered by the government.

an âimmigration skills levyâ â already being introduced for staff from the rest of the world â could be extended to the eu, the immigration minister said.

robert goodwill said the brexit result showed voters believed that companies are relying too much on migrants to fill roles.

net migration virtually unchanged in year up to the brexit vote



they had made clear that not enough was being done to ensure that âthe skills are available from our own peopleâ, he told a house of lords inquiry.

mr goodwill said an apprenticeship levy, to be brought in later this year, would help the government meet its commitment to train more than three million more apprentices by 2020.

and he added: âin april this year, we are also bringing in the immigration skills charge for non-eea skilled workers.

âif you want to recruit an indian computer programmer on a four-year contract, on top of the existing visa charges and the resident labour market test, there will be a fee of â£1,000 per year.

âso, for a four-year contract, that employer will need to pay a â£4,000 immigration skills charge.

âthat is something that currently applies to non-eu and it has been suggested to us that could be applied to eu.â

mr goodwill acknowledged he could not speculate on what the final immigration policy would be, when the final brexit settlement is reached.

however, he invited the peers to seriously consider including the immigration skills charge for eu skilled migrants within their inquiry report.

âit would be helpful to the british economy and to british workers who feel they are overlooked because of other people coming into the country getting jobs they would themselves like to get,â he said.

during the evidence session, the immigration minister also indicated that a seasonal agricultural workers scheme - allowing tens of thousands of people to work in britain in low-skilled roles for less than six months - could be introduced after brexit.

it could hand the british farming industry a significant loophole to escape the promised restrictions on eu migration without counting towards the governmentâs net migration target.

just before christmas, the national farmersâ union (nfu) pressed ministers to introduce the seasonal agricultural workers scheme, to ensure the food and farming industry can recruit short-term migrant labour.

the horticultural industry alone is estimated to need 90,000 seasonal workers by 2019, with 95 per cent of british-grown berries picked by workers from other eu countries.

mr goodwill told peers that the nfu had pressed for the scheme because of the weakness of sterling and because the post-brexit vote had put some eu workers off coming to britain.

he said: âa seasonal agricultural workers scheme would not contribute to net migration because that only includes those who come to work for more than 12 months and they come for less than six months.""

the minister reaffirmed the governmentâs commitment to get net migration down below 100,000 post-brexit.

he also said a trial scheme, which currently allows three top british universities to make a more generous offer to overseas students, could be introduced more widely.â

	london could lose 'more than 200,000 jobs amid brexit uncertainty'



margareta drzeniek-hanouz, head of global competitiveness and risks at wef, said: âurgent action is needed among leaders to identify ways to overcome political or ideological differences and work together to solve critical challenges.

âthe momentum of 2016 towards addressing climate change shows this is possible and offers hope that collective action at the international level aimed at resetting other risks could also be achieved.â

the wef says that the unexpected triumphs in 2016 for the leave campaign in the uk and mr trumpâs victory in the race for the white house areâ the most high profile indicators of disruption and a febrile political environment.

the report also warns that society is not keeping pace with technological change. it found that of the 12 emerging technologies examined in the report, artificial intelligence and robotics had the greatest potential benefits, but also the greatest negative effects and need for better governance.

cecilia reyes, chief risk officer of zurich insurance group, said:â âwe live in disruptive times where technological progress also creates challenges. without proper governance and re-skilling of workers, technology will eliminate jobs faster than it creates them.

âgovernments can no longer provide historical levels of social protection and an anti-establishment narrative has gained traction, with new political leaders blaming globalisation for societyâs challenges, creating a vicious cycle in which lower economic growth will only amplify inequality. cooperation is essential to avoid the further deterioration of government finances and the exacerbation of social unrest.â

        2016 was a surprisingly strong year for property.â 

the latest house price figures from halifax show that over the year the average value of a home rose from around â£208,500 to â£222,500 - a 6.5 per cent rise in 12 months, including a 1.7 per cent increase (â£3,600 worth) in december alone.

the rate of increase may be down on 2015, but few would have predicted such resilience as mark carney, governor of the bank of england was warning of a global slowdown in light of worrying data coming out of china back in february. they certainly didn't after the british public voted to leave the eu.

and yet even then within a few short weeks were values did indeed drop towards a 2 per cent contraction as we all held our breath and analysts warned of the mass exodus of european affluents abandoning their london boltholes that would turn a continued 'softening' at the very top of the market into a cascade of downward price pressure.

indeed, the top performing area wasn't a knightsbridge postcode or a berkshire enclave. it was luton.â 

the average house price in the bedfordshire town was almost 20 per cent higher than in the previous year, increasing from â£214,934 to â£256,636 in 2016 as buyers battling a supply shortage took advantage of relatively low prices and a commutable distance to the capital. meanwhile, homes in the outer london borough of barking and dagenham rose in value by almost 19 per cent in 12 months and dunstable â lutonâs near neighbour â completed the top three with a near 18 per cent rise.

""people who predicted the worst for the uk property market in the wake of the eu referendum vote last june have so far been proved wrong,"" mario berti, ceo of octopus property remarks.â 

""while the economic and political backdrop remains uncertain in the wake of brexit, tight supply, high levels of employment and very low borrowing costs are acting as a floor under prices.â sterling weakness will also continue to attract foreign buyers, again bolstering prices.â with both supply and borrowing costs so low, an imminent collapse in house prices looks like a remote risk.

""[p]rices are once again picking up speed slowly and steadily... however this time thereâs no reckless acceleration, but rather a smooth and cautious progression though the gears,"" says jonathan hopper, managing director of garrington property finders.

âthe chronic imbalance between demand and supply is playing a big part in driving up prices. with [royal institution of chartered surveyors] data showing that levels of unsold stock remain at a record low, competition among buyers in many areas is rising.

""with interest rates still at record lows, growing numbers of buyers are deciding that now is the time to act â and rising levels of mortgage approvals hint at a surge in purchases to come.

âdespite the momentum, some nerves among sellers remain â and more pragmatic vendors are often willing to reduce their asking price in return for the certainty of a sale.â

but other experts, particularly those who aren't directly involved in such sales, aren't convinced, includingâ martin ellis, halifax's housing economist.â 

""slower economic growth, pressure on employment and a squeeze on spending power,â together with affordability constraints, are expected to reduce housing demand during 2017.

""uk house prices should, however, continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of property forâ sale, low levels of housebuilding, and exceptionally low interest rates.

""overall, annualâ house price growth nationally is most likely expected to slow to between one and four per cent by the end of 2017,"" he adds. ""theâ relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher than normal degree of uncertainty regardingâ the prospects for the uk economy this year.""

at the same time others, such as think tank the resolution foundation, point to the ongoing divergence between prices and affordability even with a modest increase in 2017. property prices are currently rising at roughlyâ 5 times the rate of wages as part of a long-term trend that could finally make its presence felt as inflation increases kick in, denting consumer confidence justâ as the uk finally defines its independent economic future.

it could be quite a year for our precious bricks and mortar.

        the world bank has trimmed its growth forecast for the uk, in its first major review of the state of the economy since the countryâs june vote to quit the eu.

in a sweeping global report, the washington-based group says that it anticipates the uk economy to grow 1.2 per cent this year and 1.3 per cent nextâa revision from previous estimates of 2.1 per centâ annually for both years.

it predicts growth of 1.3 per cent in 2019.â

trump and brexit put global economic recovery at risk, world bank says



âthe brexit vote had limited short-term cross-border financial market spillovers, partly reflecting the commitment for further policy accommodation by major central banks,â the bank writes.â 

âhowever, it will take time to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the united kingdom and the eu, given the protracted nature of the negotiations for international trade agreements, and the unusual complexity of the issues in this case.ââ 

in the longer term, the world bank says that the magnitude of any âadverse long-run effectsâ will depend on the type of relationship that the uk ends up negotiating with the remainder of the bloc.â 

the world bankâs move mirrors similar revisions from the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development.â

it doubled down in october when it trimmed its 2017 forecast further to 1.1 per cent. at the same time though, it revised up its 2016 growth forecast to 1.8 per cent on the back of stronger than expected growth in the second quarter of the year.

        brexit and theâ trump presidency are two risks that could derail a moderate pick-up in global economic growth this year, according to the world bank.â

donald trump's conflicts of interest could bring down his presidency



announcing the findings of its latest global economic prospects (gep) report, the washington-based organisation says it expects annual growth of 2.7 per cent in 2017, a moderate pick up from that 2016 figure, helped by rising commodity prices and mr trumpâs stimulus plans.he has pledged to pursue expansionary fiscal policies, which include tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending.

but the bank alsoâ stresses that the positive impact from mr trumpâs fiscal boost could be offset by his protectionist trade policies.

there is a great deal of uncertainty around just what policies mr trump's administration will pursue in office, it notes.

âthe heightened level of policy uncertainty, especially regarding trade, has been exacerbated by recent political developmentsâmost notably, electoral outcomes in the united states and the united kingdom,"" the bank says.

âthis and other risks â particularly financial market disruptions amid tighter global financing conditions â may be amplified over time by mounting protectionist tendencies, slower potential growth and elevated vulnerabilities in some emerging markets and developing countries.â

        whatsapp and gmail face tough eu privacy proposal

online messaging and email services such as whatsapp, imessage and gmail will face tough new rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the european union executive on tuesday.

the web players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customersâ conversations and ask for their consent before tracking them online to serve them personalised ads.

the proposal by the european commission extends some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet. the commission is seeking to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and internet giants such as facebook, google and microsoft.

the proposal would also allow telecom companies to use customer metadata â such as the duration and location of calls â to provide additional services and make more money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules. however the telecoms industry said the proposal still imposed stricter obligations on them than on web companies.

lise fuhr, director general of etno, the european telecoms lobby: âunlike others, telcos risk being prevented from expanding consumer choice by using traffic and location data for big data analytics, the internet of thingsâ and connected driving services.â

the review of the so-called e-privacy law will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers. a previous leaked version would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies.

london banksâ brexit concerns falling on deaf ears

banks with large london operations say they will step up lobbying european officials because they are running out of arguments to convince the government the industry needs single market access after britain leaves the european union.

banks have focussed on pressuring british officials to push for as much market access as possible since voters decided seven months ago to leave the eu. they held fewer meetings with european officials, according to several senior sources in the financial services industry.

the focus is shifting because after scores of meetings and research reports, banks, which say they may begin moving staff and operations out of london in the next few months if there is no clarity, feel they are running out of new points to make.

the prime minister said on sunday she was not interested in britain keeping âbitsââ of its eu membership, interpreted by some as signalling she will favour immigration controls over access to the single market.

banks are now planning a new round of lobbying to highlight how a hard brexit could harm the eu and the uk. they have identified french politicians, eu regulators and government officials, as key groups to win over.

âthe battle for britain is over, the battle for france is about to begin,ââ said one senior lobbyist.

another senior lobbyist for one of the major global banks said he will spend more time in brussels this year to target the euâs chief brexit negotiator michel barnier and his teams as well as didier seeuws, a belgian diplomat, who is helping coordinate the brexit negotiations.

âcartelâ traders set to face rigging charges

prosecutors are poised to charge the currency traders at the heart of one of the biggest us market-rigging investigations, according to bloombergâs sources.

the imminent criminal charges are against members of âthe cartelâ chat group, the people said. these traders used instant messages to coordinate the rigging of foreign-exchange benchmarks by sharing confidential customer information, prosecutors have said in antitrust cases that led to guilty pleas by five banks in 2015.

the senior dealers who participated in the cartel were richard usher, formerly of jpmorgan, rohan ramchandani, formerly of citigroupâ and chris ashton, formerâ global head of spot trading at barclays. another member, matt gardiner, formerly of ubs, has been helping prosecutors build cases against the traders, sources have told bloomberg.

lawyers for mr ashton, mr gardiner and mr ramchandani declined to comment. mr usherâs lawyer didnât immediately respond to phone and e-mail requests for comment.

the men are located outside of the us, meaning they would have to be extradited, a process that can take months, if not years. they are probably going to fight back against the charges, one of the sources said.

boohoo sees sales soar 55% in bumper christmas

online retailer boohoo.com has upgraded its full-year revenue forecasts following a bumper christmas trading period.

the group said sales in four months to 31 december rose 55 per cent to â£114m, driven by a 31 per cent increase in uk sales to â£65m.

as a result, boohoo expects sales growth of between 43 per cent and 45 per cent in the year to 28 february 2017 ââ above previous guidance of between 38 per cent and 42 per cent.

in december, the online retailer revealed plans to acquire the brand of collapsed us fashion firm nasty gal in a $20m (â£16m) deal.

it came weeks after boohoo acquired rival fashion website pretty little thing for â£3.3m and upped its profit outlook following bumper black friday trading.

including pretty little thing, the firm now expects group revenue growth to be between 46 per cent and 48 per cent.

joint chief executives mahmud kamani and carol kane said: âtrading in the four months to 31 december 2016 has been strong across all regions. our strategy offering great pricing, enticing promotions and an ever-broader range of the latest fashion continues to drive growth and enhance customer lifetime value.

âin particular, sales momentum in the usa has continued robustly, helped by our strong customer proposition across the black friday weekend.â

majestic wine reports best ever christmas

majestic wine has notched up its best ever christmas trading figures as boss rowan gormley presses ahead with a transformation plan following a difficult six months.

the warehouse wine retailer said like-for-like sales rose 7.5 per cent in the 10 weeks to 2 january, an improvement on the 7.3 per cent increase it recorded last year.

total sales were up 12.4 per cent during the period, with majestic saying it is on track to meet full year expectations.

mr gormley said: âour transformation plan is working and we remain on track to achieve our â£500m sales goal. we said that we would be better prepared for christmas than ever ââ and the numbers show that we did what we said we would do.

âat this stage we are not predicting a change to long-term margin expectations, but we need to retain flexibility to compete in a competitive market.â

majestic wine swung into the red in november, racking up half-year losses of â£4.4m, but said it was at a âtipping pointââ in its return to profit growth.

the company has embarked on a three-year turnaround plan aimed at expanding and retaining its customer base, slowing down branch network expansion, and acquiring new customers for naked wines.

toshiba âasks creditors not to call in loansâ

toshiba met creditors on tuesday and asked them not to use provisions in debt agreements to call in their loans early, giving the troubled company time to work out a turnaround plan, sources with knowledge of the matter said.

it was the first such meeting since the conglomerate, which is still recovering from a $1.3bn (â£1.07bn) accounting scandal, shocked investors last month by announcing cost overruns at a us nuclear business bought in 2015 which could now mean a charge against profit topping $4bn.

about 80 creditors, including regional banks and life insurance companies, attended the meeting, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

toshiba executives briefed creditors about the background leading up to the massive write-down and the schedule of how it would work out the matter, the sources added.

the laptops-to-engineering conglomerate confirmed the meeting, but did not provide any further details.

bankers said such a meeting was rather routine for a company in trouble and that, even though credit-rating downgrades after the write-down warning put toshiba in violation of loan covenants, it was routine for them to grant waivers in such cases to avoid a funding crisis.

toshiba is expected to hold its next meeting with creditors in february, when the company is scheduled to have finalised write-down figures, the sources said.

pharmaceutical firmâ sells â£1.6bn in assets to begin paying down debt

canadian pharmaceutical firm valeant will sell just over $2bn (â£1.64bn) in assets as it pays down debts after a year and a half of bruising backlash against some of its drug prices and government probes into the way it does business.â 

shares of the canadian pharmaceutical company, down 80 per cent in the past year, jumped 12 per cent before the opening bell.â 

the company said on tuesday that it would sell three skincare brands to lâoreal for $1.3bn. the three product lines, cerave, acnefree and ambi, generate about $168m in annual revenue.â 

the announced sale comes a day after valeant said it would sell dendreonâ to chinaâs sanpower group for about $820m.â

vw group sales hit record despite âdieselgateâ

volkswagen group sales jumped 12 per cent in december to take the annual figure to a record 10.3 million vehicles, the carmaker said on tuesday, even as it grappled with its emissions scandal.

volkswagen group deliveries including luxury brands audi and porsche increased to 933,300 vehicles last month from 834,700 a year earlier, fuelled by double-digit gains in china and the united states, with the total for the year up 3.8 per cent from 9.93 million in 2015, it said.

toyota said last month it expected to end 2016 with sales of 10.09 million vehicles, slightly below an initial forecast of 10.11 million. the japanese rival had already slipped behind vw on six-month figures and is expected to report full-year deliveries in early february.

																		  the u.k.'s prime minister theresa may is expected to give a speech on the britain's divorce from the eu next tuesday.  
															
																			    														  however, analysts are cautious about the extent to which the prime minister will provide financial markets with clear details on how she sees the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu unfolding. 
															
																			    														  ""one should prepare to be disappointed on the level of detail,"" kallum pickering, senior u.k. economist at berenberg, told cnbc over the phone. 
															
																						
												    														  according to pickering, prime minister may's remarks will be ""more of the same"" where she will reiterate that she will look for ""the best possible deal for the u.k."".
															
																			    														  theresa may promised to set out her approach to brexit in the new year ahead of triggering the formal process of leaving the eu, article 50, by the end of march.
															
																			    														  richard mylles, political analyst at absolute strategy, told cnbc on friday that he cautions against expecting too much extra information from theresa may's speech on tuesday.
															
																			    														  ""theresa may is in a deceptively weak position when it comes to brexit,"" mylles said. even though theresa may is more popular than the opposition leader, she needs to please the eurosceptic and pro-eu members within her party.
															
																			    														  ""fundamentally she has a very small majority,"" mylles recalled, adding that prime minister may supported the pro-eu campaign in the lead up to the referendum. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  nonetheless, analysts and investors will be looking for details on migration, single market access, passporting rights and trade options.
															
																			    														  ""migration is the key"" issue, pickering from berenberg said. prime minister may has voiced several times that her priority is regaining control of the u.k's borders, which could indicate that britain could opt for a ""hard brexit"" -  meaning that in order to control immigration, it will lose full access to the eu's single market.
															
																			    														  ""it's clear there's a tradeoff between migration and market access,"" pickering added.
															
																			    														  european officials have expressed that there is no full access to the single market if there is no freedom of movement. so the more immigration restrictions that prime minister may makes, the more restrictions will be imposed on accessing the common market, he also said.
															
																			    														  according to business europe, within the single market, the free movement of goods generates about 25 percent of the eu's gross domestic product and accounts for 75 percent of intra-eu trade. 
															
																			    														another key issue is the future of the financial services in the u.k. this week, the lobby group thecityuk, said that it had dropped its demand that the u.k. should keep its passporting rights. 
															
																			    														  such rights essentially allow a financial services firm to market products to investors in the european region.
															
																			    														  ""as a basic scenario we should not expect the u.k. to maintain its passporting rights,"" pickering added. 
															
																			    														  in a scenario of a complete exit from the eu, the u.k. would likely trade with the eu under world trade organization rules.
															
																			    														  ""in our view, we're heading towards wto rules in the most likely scenario unfortunately,"" mylles told cnbc. 
															
																			    														  such an option would raise the costs of exporting to the eu for uk firms and it would decrease the access to eu markets for uk companies, a joint research paper from the london school of economics and the think tank centre for economic performance stated.

																		  the u.s. dollar gained against the yen and was little changed against the euro on friday, rebounding from five-week lows touched against both currencies in the prior session as u.s. retail sales data fueled expectations that the federal reserve would hike interest rates three times this year.

																		  the dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent against the yen to a session high of 115.44 after slipping to a five-week low of 113.73 thursday. the dollar had fallen on wednesday and thursday on disappointment that u.s. president-elect donald trump did not address pro-growth economic policies at his first news conference since his nov. 8 election victory.
															
																						
												    														the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose as much as 0.16 percent to 101.670 after touching a five-week low of 100.720 thursday.
															
																			    														the index later turned mostly flat and was last at 101.14, but was still set to finish the week down 0.8 percent to mark its worst week since early november.
															
																			    														""we still have strong fundamental data out of the u.s.,"" said jason leinwand, founder and chief executive of firstline fx in randolph, new jersey. analysts said traders likely saw friday's data as an opportunity to buy the dollar after its dip over the past two sessions.
															
																			    														""the market has gotten over (trump's) news conference,"" leinwand said. ""so, the pullback really became an opportunity to wait for the next set of data and reposition themselves.""
															
																			    														the retail sales data also suggested the fed would follow through with its forecast in december for three projected rate hikes this year, analysts said. the u.s. central bank's rate hikes are expected to boost the dollar by driving investment flows into the united states.

																		britain's finance industry has given up on efforts to keep full access to the european union after brexit and is pushing instead for a more limited trade deal that would potentially exclude some financial products.
															
																			    														banks, insurers and asset managers have come to the conclusion there is no realistic chance of maintaining full passporting rights after brexit that would allow them to sell all their services across the 28-nation bloc from britain.
															
																			    														thecityuk, the country' most powerful financial lobby group, has listed 17 points in a two-page document published on thursday that calls for limited market access for some finance sectors based on a pact in which britain and the eu would accept each other's rules. thiswould keep the door open for cross-border trading of stocks and bonds, and sales of certain other products.
															
																						
												    														the future of london as europe's financial center is one of the biggest issues in brexit talks because it is britain's largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax revenue. there have been estimates that britain's finance industry could lose up to 38 billion pounds ($46.07 billion) in revenue in a so-called ""hard brexit"" that would restrict its access to the eu single market. 
															
																			    														thecityuk proposals mark a shift away from calls for full passporting rights to be maintained for the finance industry after brexit.
															
																			    														""i am confident that this represents in broad shape the key priorities for the industry,"" thecityuk chief executive officer miles celic told reuters. 
															
																			    														""there are a multiple number of documents out there of stuff at significant length. so there was a sense among our membership to filterdown what the key asks were into a single place.""
															
																			    														by pushing for a bespoke deal there is a risk that some financial sectors may be excluded from any final settlement. with some bankers expecting no market access for some retail financial products.
															
																			    														but thecityuk document is the first attempt to condense the industry's priorities after months of conflicting lobbying, and comes just two months before britain plans eu divorce talks.
															
																			    														until now efforts to lobby the government and what their brexit response should be.
															
																			    														after the june vote, business leaders begged for britain to stay inside the single market, for example, by having a norway-style deal that would provide full access to europe's markets. 
															
																			    														but eu leaders have repeatedly warned that single market access is defined by the bloc's four freedoms - free movement of goods,capital, services and people - and that they cannot be unpicked.
															
																			    														prime minister theresa may said on sunday she was not interested in britain keeping ""bits"" of its eu membership, seen by some as a signal that britain will leave the single market when it leaves the european union.
															
																			    																 
																		britain should seek ""access to the widest possible range of financial and related professional products and services,"" the thecityuk document says, implying some sectors may lose access under any final deal. 
															
																			    														  thecityuk proposals call for""clear and upfront transitional arrangements"" to bridge the gap between leaving the eu and the start of a bespoke deal, though they do not specify a timeframe. 
															
																			    														  three top financiers, hsbc chairmandouglas flint, london stock exchange ceo xavier rolet, and allianz global investors vice chair elizabeth corley, called on tuesday for transitional arrangements to last two to three years after brexit. 
															
																			    														  trade experts have warned that a bespoke trade deal could take far longer. brexit supporters want a quick break with the bloc.
															
																			    																 
																		  thecityuk document favors a deal that would build on and go beyond existing so-called equivalence regimes, whereby uk financial firms could continue to serve european customers if they complied with rules the eu deems to be equal. 
															
																			    														  it said that for all products, a mutual recognition arrangement is needed, along with a framework for ""recognizing and enforcing judgments from uk jurisdictions in the eu and vice versa."" 
															
																			    														  this refers to the derivatives sector, where currently  swaps contracts negotiated between firms in all eu countries rely on uk court rulings to resolve disputes. 
															
																			    														  thecityuk document also highlights some positive effects of leaving the eu, in a marked shift from the finance industry's long-held view that staying an eu member would be the preferred option. 
															
																			    														  ""there will be opportunities arising from brexit, including from new networks of trade and investment agreements, the creation of sharia-compliant central bank liquidity facilities and fintech,"" the document said.

																		  donald trump's election represented not just a big moment in politics but also a ""paradigm shift"" in investing, according to private equity giant kkr. 
															
																			    														  the influential firm with $120 billion under management told clients that events from 2016, including trump's victory and britons voting to exit the european union, represent landmarks for a changing global environment. years of focusing on boosting financial assets like stocks and bonds will give way to growth-oriented policies, more focus on domestic agendas and increasing volatility. 
															
																			    														  ""inspired by the aforementioned catalysts, we have entered into ... a 'political bull market,'"" henry mcvey, head of global macro and asset allocation at kkr, said in a report for clients. ""from 2008-2015, this 'political bull market' took the form of more regulation, higher taxes and heightened industry scrutiny. many governments also promoted fiscal austerity, multilateral trade and aggressive monetary stimulus. however, last year's u.k. brexit vote and u.s. election of president donald trump likely presage a new chapter in this bull market story."" 
															
																						
												    														  for investors, the change means focusing on real assets including master limited partnerships, real estate and infrastructure. the firm's recommendations, however, do not include gold, which it is actively betting against in 2017 with short positions. 
															
																			    														  kkr also has moved away from its 2016 preference for credit over equity though it is a fan of private credit, or the growing market of nonbank lending. the dollar also is forecast to continue higher, and kkr has gone to a 3 percent cash position, which is 1 percentage point higher than normal.
															
																			    																 
																		taken together, kkr expects its investing thesis to provide ""mid-to-high single-digit returns ... though we are more optimistic that â almost irrespective of the environment â the ongoing rotation away from simplicity towards attractively priced complex assets could add another 300-500 basis points of alpha in 2017."" 
															
																			    														  the investing choices are geared toward a new climate wherethe focus switches from boosting financial markets to boosting income and economic growth, which has been well below trend throughout the post-great recession period. 
															
																			    														  ""not surprisingly, working citizens around the globe, particularly in the developed markets, are now tired of paying for a financial crisis that they feel they did not create and of the effects of extreme monetary policy (i.e., it is harder to increase savings with low/negative rates),"" mcvey said. ""they want less fiscal austerity and less traditional political rhetoric. they also want growth in real incomes and benefits for their families, including education, health care and retirement savings."" 
															
																			    														  as for risks, he said such transitions often have bumps along the way.  
															
																			    														  trump's plan for fiscal stimulus could have less impact with an economy running near full employment, and ""swinging wildly"" away from globalization could be dangerous as well, mcvey said.  
															
																			    														  ""said differently, a lot of cyclical stimulus would be required to overcome some of the headwinds that have defined the secular stagnation that the global economy has witnessed in recent years,"" he said. 
															
																			    																 
									  
																		london's financial bosses urged the u.k. government to consider extending brexit negotiations to a five-year transitional process in order for britain to avoid a systemic economic meltdown. 
															
																			    														  the chief executive of the london stock exchange (lse) and hsbc   chairman renewed calls for the u.k. government to clarify its future relationship with the european union (eu) in a meeting with mps at the treasury select committee on tuesday. 
															
																			    														  u.k. prime minister theresa may has pledged to start formal divorce procedures from the eu by the end of march. however, lse chief executive xavier rolet projected that a two-year negotiation process would be ""too short"" and therefore insufficient in protecting the country's financial industry.
															
																						
												    														  ""the economic system (in london) is like a jenga towerâ¦ you don't know what will happen if you pull pieces out,"" douglas flint, hsbc chairman, told mps on tuesday.
															
																			    														  ""there are two risks to jobs. one is we move the jobs, the other is the jobs are simply eliminated because the market opportunity (in europe) is unattractive,"" he added.
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		mark carney, bank of england governor, said that he agreed with douglas flint's ""jenga tower"" description regarding the precarious position of london's economic system with brexit on the horizon.
															
																			    														""i think that the financial stability risks around that process are greater on the continent than they are for the uk,"" carney said.
															
																			    														  ""i'm not saying there are not financial stability risks to the uk, and there are economic risks to the uk. but there are greater financial stability risks on the continent in the short term, for the transition, than there are for the uk.""
															
																			    																 
																		  hsbc, europe's largest bank, had reportedly been considering moving 1000 jobs to paris in the event passporting rights for the british financial sector could not be guaranteed post-brexit.  
															
																			    														  flint reaffirmed to mps attending the committee that the u.k. based lender would regard france as the most attractive european destination. given hsbc has integrated services in paris he suggested the bank could even consider taking ""pre-emptive action"" to relocate some of its operations.  
															
																			    														  lse boss rolet also cited an ey study to mps which projected 232,000 jobs could be lost from the u.k. if euro-denominated clearing is forced out of the country. rolet stressed london was in danger of losing its global leadership title and added that new york would be best placed to reap the benefits of any derivative clearing too.  
															
																			    														  rolet and flint told the committee that a five-year transitional period, after article 50 had been invoked, would enable london's businesses to maintain stability.  
															
																			    														  may suggested in december that there was a case for an ""implementation phase"" to allow businesses to adapt to the demands of the u.k.'s departure from the eu.  
															
																			    														  ""without a clear path to continued operation of our global businesses our customers simply would not wait,"" rolet said. 
															
																			    																  
																		  gold seesawed on wednesday as the stronger dollar undermined confidence, but investor buying interest due to political uncertainty is seen supporting prices this year.   
															
																			    														  spot gold was up 0.3 percent at 1,191.20 an ounce. u.s. gold futures gained 0.46 percent to $1,190.9.  
															
																			    																 
																		the trigger for early gains was nervousness ahead of u.s. president-elect donald trump's first formal news conference at 1600 gmt. investors will focus on what trump has to say about trade, relations with china and plans for the economy. 
															
																						
												    														""trump's upcoming news conference seems to be the main highlight of the day and the dollar is said to be moving up on account of this,"" said intl fcstone analyst edward meir. 
															
																			    														analysts say elections over the course of the year in france, the netherlands and germany are likely to create political tensions in the european union and support gold. 
															
																			    														""the uncertainty surrounding brexit could lead to further demand for gold from retail investors in the uk,"" quantitative commodity research analyst peter fertig said. 
															
																			    														a higher u.s. currency, near a 14-year peak against a basket of currencies, makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.  
															
																			    														further gains for the dollar due to u.s. rate hikes during the course of the year are possible. u.s. federal reserve policy makers in december signaled the possibility of three rises this year. 
															
																			    														that may mean higher u.s. treasury yields, making it cheaper for investors to buy u.s. government bonds, which like gold are seen as risk-free. but unlike gold which earns nothing and costs to insure and store, treasuries earn regular coupons. 
															
																			    														on the technical front, upside resistance kicks in around $1,194, the 55-day moving average, though traders say breaking back above $1,200 would need strong momentum. 
															
																			    														elsewhere, silver was down 0.46 percent at $16.77 an ounce from tuesday's four-week high of $16.90. 
															
																			    														platinum fell 0.52 percent to $977.70 from an earlier two-month peak at 982.60 and palladium dropped more than 1 percent to $753.80 an ounce.  
															
																			    														palladium touched a five-week high of $768.1 on monday.
															
																			    														  investors expect the industrial precious metal will benefit if tax cuts and higher government spending in the major car markets of china and the united states boost auto sales.  
															
																			    																 
																		""while the medium to longer-term demand backdrop remains compelling given its dominant usage in catalysts of gasoline fueled cars, we still expect a short-term dent,"" julius baer analysts said in a note. 
															
																			    														palladium has a close relationship with vehicle sales, which were strong last year. 
															
																			    														""sales in china were fueled by a tax cut, prompting consumers to pull forward purchases. the tax cut was halved at the beginning of this year and should result in lower sales over the course of the coming months.""     
															
																			    																  
																		  the world economic forum's (wef) flagship annual report surveyed 750 experts to identify the most significant global concerns. here are the top five:  
															
																			    																 
																		  rising income and economic disparity ranked first among experts as the most critical risk which could shape global developments over the next decade.  
															
																			    														  a prolonged period of historically low interest rates across the world is one key reason which has heightened economic concerns. previously trusted financial mechanisms which underpinned healthy economic activity were found to be in urgent need of recalculation. bank of england chief economist andrew haldane described the financial profession as ""in some degree of crisis"" last thursday. 
															
																						
												    														  china's economic slowdown remains a prominent risk, according to the wef report. in 2016, the yuan posted its biggest yearly loss against the dollar in over two decades, making it the worst performing major asian currency for the calendar year. 
															
																			    														  the report concluded the path back to robust rates of economic growth was increasingly difficult to foresee.  
															
																			    						    		

	 

					    														  dani rodrik, harvard economist, proposed a theory which described ""the globalization trilemma"" in which among democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration, only two could be simultaneously compatible. recent political events in europe and the u.s. suggest democracy and national sovereignty would be the priorities moving forwards, according to the report.  
															
																			    																 
									 
																		  brexit, president-elect donald trump's victory and the rise of populism are all geopolitical risks, according to respondents to the global risks perception survey (grps). 
															
																			    														  issues surrounding identity and culture were found to be at the root of the pivotal political outcomes of 2016. 
															
																			    														  perceived political outsiders outperformed the establishment by being able to better engage with traditional voters on concerns regarding sovereignty and national pride, according to the survey's findings. 
															
																			    														  unusually, older voters were found to be the driving force of political movements over the past 12 months and so, with populations ageing, the report suggested that the pendulum is unlikely to swing back to the younger generation for some time. 
															
																			    																 
																		  technological developments were found to be a more sound explanation for industrial decline and deteriorating labor-market prospects than globalization, according to the latest annual wef report. 
															
																			    														  drastic change in technology was said to have accelerated problems in geopolitical stability, job security and even social relationships.  
															
																			    														  the so-called fourth industrial revolution (fir) has created an unprecedented amount of new global risks as well as exacerbating existing problems, according to the report. artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics were found to pose the greatest danger over the coming decade.  
															
																			    														  ""artificial intelligence will enable us to address some of the great issues of our age, such as climate change and population growth, much more effectively,"" john drzik, the president of global risks and specialties at marsh, which collaborated on the report, said in a note. 
															
																			    														  ""however, increased reliance on ai will dramatically exacerbate existing risks, such as cyber, making the development of mitigation measures just as crucial,"" he added. 
															
																			    																 
																		  grps experts noted an alarming step back from international commitments in 2016. 
															
																			    														  the landmark paris climate change pact had come under fire throughout donald trump's campaign for presidency and he has vowed to pull out of the deal following his inauguration on january 20. trump has previously described climate change as a hoax. 
															
																			    														  president barrack obama described the adoption of clean energy in the u.s. as ""irreversible"" in a science journal article on monday. the published opinion piece put pressure on his successor, donald trump, not to back away from the paris climate change agreement. 
															
																			    														  however, the departure of major stakeholders from the trans-pacific partnership and trans-atlantic trade and investment partnership were also geopolitically significant, grps respondents said. moreover, an absence of a unified international accord to support the united nations (un) handicapped efforts to provide humanitarian relief and protect civilians in syria, according to the report. 
															
																			    														  ""urgent action is needed among leaders to identify ways to overcome political or ideological differences and work together to solve critical challenges,"" margareta drzeniek-hanouz, head of global competitiveness and risks at wef, said in a note. 
															
																			    														  ""the momentum of 2016 towards addressing climate change shows this is possible, and offers hope that collective action at the international level aimed at resetting other risks could also be achieved,"" she added. 
															
																			    																 
									 
																		  environmental risks have dominated the wef's global risks report for the past seven years and the group's 2017 edition has proved to be no exception. 
															
																			    														  extreme weather events, climate change and water crises have consistently featured among the top-ranked global risks over the past decade and the experts surveyed urged for action to be accelerated in order to limit any environmental risks.  
															
																			    														  the paris agreement, which has now been ratified by more than 110 countries, as well as empirical evidence that a global transition to a low-carbon economy is underway were highlighted as reasons to be hopeful yet the report stressed the pace of change is not quick enough. 
															
																			    														  the year 2016 is poised to be the warmest on record according to the world meteorological organization and the un's 2016 emissions gap report projected that the world would need to eradicate emissions altogether by the year 2100 in order to avoid dangerous climate change. 
															
																			    														  multidimensional cooperation would be required to aid governments and international agencies in order to respond adequately to structural environmental risks, according to the report. though in the current political climate, adopting an internationally connected cooperation would be challenging, the wef report concluded it would be necessary.

																		  business and political leaders across the world are getting ready for this year's davos edition, but the political context in which they will be meeting is completely new.  
															
																			    														  following the election of donald trump in the u.s. and the british vote to leave the eu, companies are taking a more ""defensive"" approach. at the same time, experts believe that china will strengthen its influence as a world power as the u.s. takes a more protectionist view.
															
																			    														  ""corporations, if you will, i think they are going to be on the defensive potentially on the back foot at davos for the first time in a long time,"" john studzinski, vice chairman of blackstone, told cnbc on tuesday. 
															
																						
												    														  according to studzinski, there has been a ""drastic policy shift from 2008, which was very much an international financial crisis to today where you have people and governments focusing on challenging the status quo and going from big international concerns to pure domestic populist issues.""
															
																			    														  a surge in support for populist views was evident in 2016 and populism continues to dominate market concerns going into 2017. the surprising votes in britain and the u.s. caused some market turmoil, but above all they raised uncertainty regarding their next policy directions.
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  for example, the intention of president-elect trump 
 to withdraw from a trade agreement signed with asian pacific countries raises uncertainty for companies that were set to increase business with those countries.  
															
																			    														  in europe, businesses from the retail sector to banking are unsure how their current partnerships with u.k-based firms will be, and vice-versa, once the u.k. government begins its exit negotiations.  
															
																			    														""market volatility this year is much more driven by uncertainties driven by the new cast of leadership that the world has been presented with,"" studzinski said.  
															
																			    														upcoming elections across europe could alter the political landscape. the netherlands, france and germany have elections scheduled in the coming months but more ballots could be called in 2017 across the eu. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		mark malloch-brown, senior adviser at eurasia, described the current global environment as a new world ""disorder"" with new influencers shaping the present and future. 
															
																			    														  ""the story of 2017 is going to be china's growing influence and ascension of its power,"" malloch-brown told cnbc on tuesday. 
															
																			    														  data released tuesday showed that the chinese economy is performing above expectations. producer prices rose to a five-year high in december.  
															
																			    														  ""the fact that president xi is opening davos is a strong statement that china sees himself as front and center on the world stage today,"" studzinski of blackstone added.  
															
																			    														  xi is the first ever chinese president to attend the world economic forum at davos.  
															
																			    														  studzinski also recognized that political parties could no longer rely on voters backing the status quo.  
															
																			    														  ""we have to be very honest about this. donald trump was elected because he was donald trump. marine le pen might be elected because she is marine le penã¢ââ¦donald trump wasn't elected because of his policies, he was elected because he was an interesting, changing-agent, personality and perceived leader,"" studzinski said.

																		  the rising crowds descending on the world economic forum's annual summit in davos each year are forcing the event's organizers to consider housing some staff in temporary 'container pods' as a solution to the growing accommodation crunch.
															
																			    														  the pre-fabricated modular units are indeed being considered as one of several options for world economic forum (wef) employees as of 2018, says yann zopf, a spokesman for the non-profit organization in emailed comments to cnbc.
															
																			    														  however, according to zopf, earlier attempts by the media to characterize the pods as akin to transportation boxes stretch reality.
															
																						
												    														  ""they are not containers actually and even less 'shipping containers' as some wrote but temporary wood structures like these,"" explained zopf, indicating products constructed by uffer as an example (shown here).
															
																			    														  zopf said that at the 2017 conference, as in prior years, staff would be housed in apartments although the pressure on supply is continuously augmented by an approximately 10 percent increase in wef employees each year, some of which would be attending the summit. 
															
																			    																 
																		the tiny swiss mountain town of davos ã¢ââ which carries the distinction of being the highest 'town' in europe at 5,120 feet of altitude - counted a permanent population of around 11,000 residents in 2015. 
															
																			    														  the decade-long decline in population experienced by the town runs in stark contrast to the continually growing numbers of those flocking to the elite wef gathering each year. 
															
																			    														  in addition to the more than 2,500 participants expected this year ã¢ââ a sharp rise from the 444 who attended the first meet in 1971 ã¢ââ the total crowd in davos is expected to burgeon to around 30,000 this year, in line with 2016's numbers, once other attendees including entourages, media and technical teams and those hoping to hobnob with the world's one percent are included.
															
																			    														  online homestay marketplace airbnb is anticipating welcoming double the amount of guests at this year's conference compared to last year, equating to numbers around five times higher than in a regular week at davos, according to a spokesperson in emailed comments to cnbc. 
															
																			    																 
																		   indeed, comparisons with regular weeks in the prestigious resort are staggering in terms of both volume and price levels.
															
																			    														  as of the thursday prior to the conference kick-off the following tuesday, only one single room was shown to be available in the entire davos ski resort.
															
																			    														  booking the non-refundable ""budget single room"" which offers a twin bed, shared bathroom and kitchen and less than 200 square foot of space would set you back ãâ£1,822 ($2,215) for the duration of the three-night conference.
															
																			    														  however, the same abode during the following week's tuesday to friday period would put only a notably more gentle ãâ£158 dint in your wallet.

																		  the u.k.'s prime minister theresa may is expected to give a speech on the britain's divorce from the eu next tuesday.  
															
																			    														  however, analysts are cautious about the extent to which the prime minister will provide financial markets with clear details on how she sees the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu unfolding. 
															
																			    														  ""one should prepare to be disappointed on the level of detail,"" kallum pickering, senior u.k. economist at berenberg, told cnbc over the phone. 
															
																						
												    														  according to pickering, prime minister may's remarks will be ""more of the same"" where she will reiterate that she will look for ""the best possible deal for the u.k."".
															
																			    														  theresa may promised to set out her approach to brexit in the new year ahead of triggering the formal process of leaving the eu, article 50, by the end of march.
															
																			    														  richard mylles, political analyst at absolute strategy, told cnbc on friday that he cautions against expecting too much extra information from theresa may's speech on tuesday.
															
																			    														  ""theresa may is in a deceptively weak position when it comes to brexit,"" mylles said. even though theresa may is more popular than the opposition leader, she needs to please the eurosceptic and pro-eu members within her party.
															
																			    														  ""fundamentally she has a very small majority,"" mylles recalled, adding that prime minister may supported the pro-eu campaign in the lead up to the referendum. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  nonetheless, analysts and investors will be looking for details on migration, single market access, passporting rights and trade options.
															
																			    														  ""migration is the key"" issue, pickering from berenberg said. prime minister may has voiced several times that her priority is regaining control of the u.k's borders, which could indicate that britain could opt for a ""hard brexit"" -  meaning that in order to control immigration, it will lose full access to the eu's single market.
															
																			    														  ""it's clear there's a tradeoff between migration and market access,"" pickering added.
															
																			    														  european officials have expressed that there is no full access to the single market if there is no freedom of movement. so the more immigration restrictions that prime minister may makes, the more restrictions will be imposed on accessing the common market, he also said.
															
																			    														  according to business europe, within the single market, the free movement of goods generates about 25 percent of the eu's gross domestic product and accounts for 75 percent of intra-eu trade. 
															
																			    														another key issue is the future of the financial services in the u.k. this week, the lobby group thecityuk, said that it had dropped its demand that the u.k. should keep its passporting rights. 
															
																			    														  such rights essentially allow a financial services firm to market products to investors in the european region.
															
																			    														  ""as a basic scenario we should not expect the u.k. to maintain its passporting rights,"" pickering added. 
															
																			    														  in a scenario of a complete exit from the eu, the u.k. would likely trade with the eu under world trade organization rules.
															
																			    														  ""in our view, we're heading towards wto rules in the most likely scenario unfortunately,"" mylles told cnbc. 
															
																			    														  such an option would raise the costs of exporting to the eu for uk firms and it would decrease the access to eu markets for uk companies, a joint research paper from the london school of economics and the think tank centre for economic performance stated.  
															
																			    														
															
																			    																  
																		  resilient consumer confidence helped boost u.k. retailers this week, but problems lie ahead warns ubs. 
															
																			    														in a report published today, the ubs evidence lab team argues that u.k. consumer confidence was robust following the shock of the eu referendum result earlier in 2016. this is reflected in the positive third quarter trade data from u.k. retailers this week.
															
																			    														marks & spencer announced better than expected sales performance in the third quarter, while tesco reported underlying sales rose 0.7 percent over christmas. two other u.k. food retailers, sainsbury and morrison, also reported sales growth.
															
																						
												    																 
																		  the evidence lab conducted a survey of u.k. consumers in september and found evidence of confidence and optimism among consumers 
															
																			    														  ""when the ubs evidence lab survey was conducted in september 2016, respondents had clearly recovered from any initial concerns over the consequences of the eu referendum vote,"" the ubs team said in the research report. 
															
																			    														  ""there was a calm and balanced outlook for the housing market, and for expectations of changes in personal financial circumstances."" 
															
																			    														  however, there is evidence that the recent confidence may be debt-fueled. bank of england data released last week indicated personal debt grew by 10.8 percent in the 12 months to november, totaling â£192.2 billion ($234.85 billion). of this, credit card debt made up â£66.7 billion.  
															
																			    														  further, the ubs team now believes that consumer optimism was misplaced and will not last through 2017. 
															
																			    														  ""inflation is set to accelerate over the coming months, and when it does, the squeeze on disposable income will not be alleviated, in our view, by offsetting strength in wages. a historically low savings ratio and elevated personal debt levels mean alternative ways of replacing lost spending power are also set to be absent."" 
															
																			    														  the team warns as a result that confidence and spending will take a hit, which would be a negative outcome for the economy.

																		  the diamond industry is facing a period of consolidation, but one upstart jeweler is steadily carving out a reputation for himself in a sector that's becoming less dominated by major jewelry producers. 
															
																			    														  in 2012, zameer kassam, a former mckinsey analyst with a family background in jewelry, made the leap from the business world into jewelry design. armed with a harvard mba, kassam told cnbc his business model is ""the complete opposite of opposite of everything in the industry,"" and hinges on millenials â currently the hottest demographic in business. 
															
																			    														  ""there's been a seismic shift in how millennials think about diamonds and rings,"" the 37-year-old jeweler said in a recent interview. ""they don't want something that everyone has. they don't place the same value in traditional brands across hotels, vehicles. it has to be personal."" 
															
																						
												    														after a tenure at de beers louis vuitton and angara, kassam decided to commit his life to jewelry. his brand was born out of his passion for designing rings as well as working with clients, something he found difficult to do in a traditional luxury environment.  
															
																			    														  personalizing jewelry is exactly what kassam is looking to do with his eponymous brand, zameer kassam fine jewelry. his own efforts coincide with a broad push by the diamond industry to spur diamond sales among millennials in a bid to revamp its image. advertising to the demographic is less focused on traditional ideas, and more on the emotional bond represented by the gem. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		kassam's model incorporates the personal background of a couple into the design of their engagement ring, which in some cases can sell for tens of thousands of dollars each. kassam takes the client through three steps: a diamond tutorial, a casual conversation about the couple's story, and storytelling, where ideas and designs for the ring take flight.  
															
																			    														  ""it's not just, 'oh she likes red, so here's a red stone inside,'"" kassam told cnbc. ""this has to tell your story. 'it is truly made only for me and it's infused with details about him and me.'"" 
															
																			    														kassam's company, in partnership with the de beers group, is an exclusive retailer of forevermark diamonds. prices generally start at $10,000 for engagement rings and $5,000 for other pieces.

																		  affixing more personal stories to diamonds â and infusing them with more meaning and emotion â has become a way to help reheat a cooling industry, which recent data from bain & company show has only begun to rebound after a period of weakness. a sell-off in inventory during 2015 helped generate a 20 percent bounce in rough diamond sales last year, according to bain.

																		you're finally in davos. or shortly on your way. you're packing, or unpacking, your winter gear. you have a list of people to contact when you land and a  list of parties you want to hit. 
															
																			    														and, of course, you have an expanding to-do list full of all the meetings and seminars on world economic forum themes such as responsible leadership, global economic trends, and how various market sectors can survive the coming fourth industrial revolution. 
															
																			    														that's all great, but to do all that, you actually have to survive davos yourself. so as we learn about how the world can make the best use of resources for a sustainable future, we need to do the same for ourselves. it's like what they say on airplanes: secure your own oxygen mask first before helping others.
															
																						
												    														
															
																			    																 
																		 so how do you not just survive this week, but make the most of it and thrive? let's start with the big one: sleep. even in normal circumstances, most people don't get enough of it. too many, including plenty at davos, still buy into the delusion that sleep deprivation is a kind of badge of honor, or at least the price we have to pay to get ahead. but the science tells us â conclusively â the opposite: we're more productive, creative, make better decisions and perform better cognitively when we're well-rested.
															
																			    														    but sleep is even more challenging when you're traveling across several time zones. jet-lag can wreak real havoc, leading to depression, faulty memory and impaired judgment â not exactly the recipe for a productive week. 
															
																			    														    there are proven ways to mitigate jet-lag. first tip: put down that food. researchers have found that when food is plentiful, our circadian rhythms are strongly linked to cycles of light and dark. but when food is scarce, our system uncouples from the light-dark cycle to allow for more time to find food, helping you adjust more quickly to your new time zone. research suggests that not eating at all for around 16 hours can trigger this response. so, for a 10-hour flight, you should stop eating six hours before and then refrain from those in-fight goodies during the flight itself. 
															
																			    														    or, there's actually something called the anti-jet-lag-diet, created by the biologist charles ehret. four days before your flying, alternate two cycles of feasting and fasting, switching every two days, making sure to sync the last fasting day with your travel day.
															
																			    														    though one of the best jet-lag tips is this: don't start off already lagging! getting ready for any work trip can be nearly as hectic as being there, so don't forget to get enough sleep where it's easiest: in your own bed.
															
																			    														    so, now you've touched down, and, however jet-lagged, you need to get some sleep while you're in davos. even when you're not at a bustling conference, sleep in any new venue is challenging. and scientists know why. it's called the ""first night-effect."" what happens is that on our first night in a new environment, parts of our brains stay active and alert for threats (which at the wef might mean someone breaking into your room and disrupting your sleep to talk about disruption).
															
																			    														    so because you can't control being in a new environment, you should control what you can. along with your winter boots -- and, if you're adventurous, your ski gear -- make sure to bring your regular nighttime routine with you (it takes up no space in your carry-on). sleep in your regular nighttime clothes, drink the same tea, read the same book. whatever your routine is, keep itâ¦routine. and, very important â don't sleep with your phone on or near your bed. our devices are our repositories of everything we need to distance ourselves from to go to sleep â our work, to-do-lists, worries and anxieties. so physically distancing yourself from your phone will help you sleep, and ensure you both wake up fully charged.   
															
																			    																 
																		    so that's the nighttime, what about the daytime? of course, the two are connected. that's why it's important to guard against schedule creep - especially daunting in davos. the wef annual meeting can be overwhelming â there seems to be no end to fascinating and valuable panels and forums. and while they're all worthwhile, being able truly to take in insights about responsible leadership requires responsible conference-going. don't try to do too much. and, do you really need to catch that night-cap with someone you can just as easily see next week at home? 
															
																			    														    and unlike the machines, robots, and artificial intelligence algorithms you'll hear about as part of the fourth industrial revolution, humans need downtime. so build some into your days â time to take a break, meet some new people, wander, or just wonder. you'll be much more present and focused for the panels â and parties â you said yes to. and having regular downtime during the day to digest all that you've learned will make it more likely you'll be able to say goodnight to all the excitement when you get back to your hotel, having responsibly said no to that nightcap.
															
																			    														    unlike las vegas, the point of the wef is that what goes on in davos shouldn't stay in davos, but instead go back home with participants from all over the world. and for that to happen, for you to be truly present, open to collaboration, able to have insights and make connections you wouldn't have at home, you need to take care of yourself, sleep, and build in some unstructured time. oh, and if you hit the slopes, take it easy â davos is a lot less fun in a cast.

																		chinese president xi jinping is about to take center stage at the ultimate gathering of globalists from the world over, and he hopes to make his country the middle of global attention while he's at it.
															
																			    														xi will speak before elite business and political leaders at the world economic forum in davos next tuesday, just days before populist president-elect donald trump is sworn into office in the united states. beijing will use the appearance in switzerland to favorably contrast xi and china with trump and the united states.
															
																			    														already before taking office, trump has leaned hard on american companies to keep operations in the u.s., and he has chosen vocal china critics for top positions on trade and defense. in contrast, xi is expected in his opening plenary speech to play up china as a proponent of globalization.
															
																						
												    														""i think china's trying to send a signal that it's the world's most responsible stakeholder. the u.s. by contrast is a greater source of anxiety, tensions and volatility,"" said scott kennedy, deputy director, freeman chair in china studies, at the center for strategic and international studies. 
															
																			    														  ""the growing tensions between the u.s. and china gives this a bigger, larger significance than it otherwise would have,"" he said. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  xi will be the first chinese president to attend the world economic forum's davos gathering and comes as part of a state visit to switzerland, just ahead of the lunar new year. xi is a well-traveled chinese leader who is also expected to consolidate his own power within china at a communist party congress this fall.  
															
																			    														  as the leader of the world's second-largest economy, xi will embrace the opportunity at davos to show that the international community needs to pay attention to china's interests. 
															
																			    														  ""more than ever, china has to raise a voice, when we know president-elect trump is challenging, criticizing china,"" said richard attias, who produced the world economic forum in davos for 15 years and now heads consulting firm richard attias & associates. ""when you are challenged you need to react and i think what president xi is doing is right."" 
															
																			    														  at davos, the chinese ""will talk to the businesses coming to explain to them, despite all the promises of president-elect trump, [that] china will still be an interesting place to invest and include in your strategies,"" attias said. 
															
																			    														  beijing has taken several recent steps to position more at the center of global trade and finance. last january, china launched the asian infrastructure investment bank to serve as a financing alternative to the u.s.-led world bank. more recently, china is stepping in replace the united states as the central player in pacific trade, following the u.s. congress' failure to ratify the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement that was negotiated by the obama administration.
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  china's investments include projects in africa, latin america and the european union, and beijing's ""one belt, one road"" program seeks to build infrastructure that links the country to surrounding underdeveloped regions.  
															
																			    														  china's heavily state-influenced companies have been on a buying spree, snapping up businesses, property and technology from europe, japan, australia and the united states. last year, china's global outbound foreign direct investment jumped by a whopping 40 percent to an estimated nearly $200 billion, according to a report released this month by rhodium group and the mercator institute for china studies in berlin.  
															
																			    														  supported by a growing awareness that china uses protectionism and state supports to give its companies unfair advantages against the rest of the world, the trump administration wants to reset the relationship between the two countries.  
															
																			    														  ""i sense a lot of anxiety here in part because they're not really sure what the ask is from the incoming administration,"" kennedy said, speaking from beijing. ""they are not ... sure what they are going to do and whether [when] they achieve those things they can achieve equilibrium.""  
															
																			    														  trump has picked ""death by china"" author peter navarro to head a newly formed national trade council, and tapped for the u.s. trade representative post robert lighthizer, a lawyer who's fought against china dumping steel into the u.s. market.  
															
																			    														  trump's ""selection of the key economic advisors in the new administration, suggests there's likely to be increased tensions in coming years,"" said yukon huang, a senior fellow in the carnegie asia program and formerly the world bank's country director for china.  
															
																			    														  that means in his davos speech, xi ""also has to indicate intentions in the future to continue liberalizing â¦ objectives which the u.s. leaders and european leaders would want to support,"" huang said.  
															
																			    														  xi has been criticized outside of china for slowing or reversing some of the country's progress toward greater openness and economic liberalization. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    																  
																		  the rising crowds descending on the world economic forum's annual summit in davos each year are forcing the event's organizers to consider housing some staff in temporary 'container pods' as a solution to the growing accommodation crunch.
															
																			    														  the pre-fabricated modular units are indeed being considered as one of several options for world economic forum (wef) employees as of 2018, says yann zopf, a spokesman for the non-profit organization in emailed comments to cnbc.
															
																			    														  however, according to zopf, earlier attempts by the media to characterize the pods as akin to transportation boxes stretch reality.
															
																						
												    														  ""they are not containers actually and even less 'shipping containers' as some wrote but temporary wood structures like these,"" explained zopf, indicating products constructed by uffer as an example (shown here).
															
																			    														  zopf said that at the 2017 conference, as in prior years, staff would be housed in apartments although the pressure on supply is continuously augmented by an approximately 10 percent increase in wef employees each year, some of which would be attending the summit. 
															
																			    																 
																		the tiny swiss mountain town of davos ã¢ââ which carries the distinction of being the highest 'town' in europe at 5,120 feet of altitude - counted a permanent population of around 11,000 residents in 2015. 
															
																			    														  the decade-long decline in population experienced by the town runs in stark contrast to the continually growing numbers of those flocking to the elite wef gathering each year. 
															
																			    														  in addition to the more than 2,500 participants expected this year ã¢ââ a sharp rise from the 444 who attended the first meet in 1971 ã¢ââ the total crowd in davos is expected to burgeon to around 30,000 this year, in line with 2016's numbers, once other attendees including entourages, media and technical teams and those hoping to hobnob with the world's one percent are included.
															
																			    														  online homestay marketplace airbnb is anticipating welcoming double the amount of guests at this year's conference compared to last year, equating to numbers around five times higher than in a regular week at davos, according to a spokesperson in emailed comments to cnbc. 
															
																			    																 
																		   indeed, comparisons with regular weeks in the prestigious resort are staggering in terms of both volume and price levels.
															
																			    														  as of the thursday prior to the conference kick-off the following tuesday, only one single room was shown to be available in the entire davos ski resort.
															
																			    														  booking the non-refundable ""budget single room"" which offers a twin bed, shared bathroom and kitchen and less than 200 square foot of space would set you back ãâ£1,822 ($2,215) for the duration of the three-night conference.
															
																			    														  however, the same abode during the following week's tuesday to friday period would put only a notably more gentle ãâ£158 dint in your wallet.

																			    																    malta's prime minister joseph muscat suggested that a transitional trade pact to allow sectors to adapt would mean britain continuing to be bound by judgements from eu courts. but conservative bernard jenkin said such a deal would be ""unacceptable"". mr muscat's government currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu. his comments come after british prime minister theresa may pledged to take the uk out of the jurisdiction of the european court. mrs may, who will deliver a keynote brexit address next tuesday, told last autumn's conservative party conference: ""we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice."" but the maltese premier made clear that any transition trade arrangements, which could last well into the 2020s, would see european institutions retain the upper hand. ""an essential part of those transitional arrangements will be the governing institutions of that period,"" he said, according to the times. ""it is pretty clear to me that the institutions should be the european institutions. ""so it is not a transition period where british institutions take over, but it is a transition period where the european court of justice is still in charge of dishing out judgements."" but mr jenkin, a director of the vote leave campaign and chairman of the influential commons public administration committee, dismissed the maltese prime minister's claims. ""an extended period of transition really is the worst possible scenario for the eu and the uk,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. ""most people want to end the uncertainty and this would be a way of prolonging the uncertainty, which we don't want. ""the choices we're faced with, even if we leave without a deal, substantially, apart from the sort of divorce proceedings, we still get most favoured nation status under wto [world trade organization] rules, which is how we trade with the rest of the world. that's a much better position for us to be in than present membership of the eu, which costs so much and loses so much control."" he also poured scorn on malta's intervention in the brexit debate. ""what you've got is a maltese prime minister who's anxious to scoop for his tiny little island some of the spoils that he believes will fall out of brexit,"" he said. ""most countries aren't in the eu - they are absolutely fine. the biggest transition the eu wants is for us to continue paying into the eu budget for as long as possible. ""they are absolutely paranoid about us leaving because we take away our net contribution, which is a very substantial contribution to the eu budget. ""of course there will be lots of things we'll continue to co-operate with the european union, on defence and security, and foreign policy, which are unconditional - they are not part of the negotiations. ""when you talk to business they want us to get on with this. even most people who were in favour of remaining in the eu have accepted the decision - and they want certainty as quickly as possible."" mr jenkin said it was ""far easier to leave the eu because you don't have to change anything to leave the eu - you just carry all the eu law into our own law and carry on as before"". mrs may, who has said she will trigger article 50 - the formal process for leaving the european union - by april, is under pressure to spell out the government's negotiating stance. but labour leader jeremy corbyn says mrs may is overseeing a ""shambolic tory brexit"".   following a meeting with theresa may, he said he hoped this would happen ""as soon as possible"". mrs may said both countries already enjoy a strong and growing trading relationship worth over £3bn last year. international trade secretary liam fox will be visiting new zealand in the coming months, she said. mrs may said her colleague would begin a bilateral dialogue between the two nations with the ultimate aim of striking a trade deal. the small oceanic country of less than five million people is believed to be seen in government circles as one of the best prospects for an early trade deal once britain quits the eu. britain is the second largest foreign investor in new zealand and its fifth largest bilateral trading partner. it is also one of the global ""five eyes"" partners which share their security intelligence with the uk, along with the us, canada and australia. speaking at a press conference, mr english said: ""we're ready to negotiate a high quality free trade agreement with the uk when it's in a position to do so. ""we already have a strong and diversified trading relationship with the uk and a free trade agreement will build on that... ""we would hope that we could negotiate as soon as possible after the exit is completed. if the uk want to demonstrate that they can negotiate a high quality trade agreement, then new zealand is the ideal partner for that."" mrs may said new zealand is important to the uk because of its historic ties, its shared values and belief in free trade.  ""as two island nations we know that trade is essential to the prosperity of our countries and it's natural that we share a firm, deep-rooted belief in the power of free trade and open markets to drive economic progress and the importance of ensuring the benefits of growth are shared widely and fairly,"" she said. ""while the uk remains in the eu we will work together to support an eu-new zealand trade deal and we will also look to the future and how we can expand our trade and investment partnership... ""in the longer term we agree on the potential for a bold, new uk-new zealand free trade agreement and i look forward to starting early discussions on this in due course.""   mark carney said that action by the bank before and after the vote to leave the european union had reduced the danger to the country's financial stability. he added, however, that the overall level of risk was still ""elevated"". the risk was greater for continental europe than for the uk, he said. the governor also told members of the treasury select committee that a period of transition was ""highly advisable"". ""if there is not such a transition put in place, in our view it will have consequences.  we will work to mitigate those consequences as much as possible,"" he said. mr carney said that the uk should concentrate on stable access to financial markets after brexit.  the financial services industry could suffer ""outsize"" consequences from losing only some of its access. he also expressed the belief that it would not only be possible, but desirable for the uk to remain part of the eu mechanisms that make financial rules.  he said the eu and the uk were starting from the position of having the same rules. the regulators know each other, he added, and it is a ""tightly wound ecosystem"". in the face of questions from conservative mp jacob rees-mogg, mr carney insisted the bank had identified the risk to the financial sector from the brexit vote ""correctly"".   last week, the bank of england's chief economist, andrew haldane, admitted that some criticisms of economic forecasts about the immediate impact of a brexit vote were justified.  mr carney told the committee that economic forecasting had improved since the financial crisis, by being more pessimistic. ""as you'd expect a bunch of dour central bankers to be, we're focused on the downside and less focused on how everything could turn out well, but what could go really wrong... and where can we potentially mitigate that. ""we do have to ask ourselves continually what could go wrong. we don't have to see a ghost behind every corner, but we do have to ask ourselves what could go wrong."" mr carney agreed with the chairman of hsbc that the financial structure of the city was like a jenga tower.  giving evidence to the treasury select committee on tuesday on the effect of the move towards brexit, douglas flint suggested that when blocks are removed, the impact is hard to predict. ""it's a decent analogy,"" said mr carney, ""just like when you start jenga, and you start early on, there's some pretty obvious pieces that you can start taking out without really imperilling the tower.""   theresa may, who has said she will trigger article 50 - the formal process for leaving the european union - by april, will make the speech on tuesday. the government has been under pressure to spell out its negotiating stance but says it cannot show its hand in detail. labour's jeremy corbyn says mrs may is overseeing a ""shambolic tory brexit"". mrs may has refused to be drawn on the details of her plans for brexit negotiations with the 27 other eu member states as britain begins the two-year article 50 process. but she told parliament's liaison committee in december:  ""we've also said we will publish more information about our approach before article 50 is triggered.  ""i will be making a speech early in the new year setting out more about our approach and about the opportunity i think we have as a country to use this process to forge a truly global britain that embraces and trades with countries across the world."" on thursday, her official spokeswoman said: ""she will be making a speech on tuesday, setting out more on our approach to brexit, as part of preparing for the negotiations and in line with our approach for global britain and continuing to be an outward-looking nation."" bbc political correspondent chris mason said mrs may would be wary of promising more than she could deliver - or being so specific about her aims that other eu countries could set the price for achieving them impossibly high.  her words would be scoured by different audiences - mps, 27 other eu states and the uk electorate, he added. shadow brexit secretary keir starmer said: ""so far the prime minister has refused to provide any clarity about the government's basic brexit negotiating stance.  ""that has caused great uncertainty and confusion.  ""the prime minister must therefore take this opportunity to reassure the country that she has a plan for brexit and that she will fight for a deal that prioritises jobs, the economy and delivers trading arrangements that are free of tariffs and bureaucratic impediments."" the speech comes as the supreme court is preparing to rule on whether mrs may has the right to trigger article 50 without a vote in parliament - something she has said she will do before the end of march.    a £1,000 immigration ""skills charge"" is being brought in this april for firms recruiting workers from outside the eu. mr goodwill told peers a similar levy for eu workers ""may be something that has been suggested to us could apply"". one business group said the idea had ""raised eyebrows"" while a top european politician said it was ""shocking"".  but downing street said mr goodwill's remarks had been ""misinterpreted"" and such a levy was ""not on the government's agenda"". the government says the decision to leave the eu will give the uk greater control over its borders but british firms are concerned about their capacity to fill vacancies, particularly for low-paid seasonal work, if there are limits on migration from the eu. appearing before the lords eu home affairs sub-committee, mr goodwill referred to an annual £1,000 charge on businesses for every skilled worker they employ from outside europe, which will take effect in two months time. the levy, which applies to workers in ""skilled areas"" but with exemptions for phd-level posts, is designed to reduce firms' reliance on migrant labour and encourage them to train more local workers.  ""that's something that currently applies to non-eu,"" the mp said. ""that may be something that's been suggested to us that could apply to eu."" home affairs correspondent danny shaw said mr goodwill had raised the question of the charge himself rather than in response to questioning from mps, suggesting he wanted to ""float the idea"".  mr goodwill also suggested a seasonal scheme to enable agricultural workers, such as fruit pickers, to come to britain for short periods was a possibility, telling mps ""that's certainly one of the options that could be open to us post-brexit"". the national farmers union supported such an idea for workers from outside the eu, he added.  about 60,000 seasonal workers come to the uk each summer, mainly from eastern europe, and ministers have said british farmers must continue to have access to a supply of labour after the uk's exit.  between 2007 and 2014, uk firms were allowed to employ a certain number of fruit pickers from bulgaria and romania for a six-month period but this scheme expired when transitional work restrictions on the two countries following their entry to the eu were lifted. the government has said it remains committed to reducing annual net migration to less than 100,000 a year although it has consistently failed to meet the target, with the figure remaining above 300,000 for the past 18 months.  in the year to june 2016, a record number of eu citizens - 284,000 - came to live in britain.  many conservative mps want a level playing field for eu and non-eu workers, believing brexit is an opportunity to end the preferential treatment eu workers currently receive in the immigration system.   but former business minister anna soubry - who backs the uk staying in the eu's single market - said a levy would be a ""tax on successful businesses"". ""discouraging eu nationals from coming to britain would harm our economy, deterring investment and hitting our public finances,"" she said. former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt, who is leading the european parliament's brexit team and is a strong supporter of the continued right to free movement across europe, tweeted: ""imagine, just for a moment, what the uk headlines would be, if the eu proposed this for uk nationals? shocking."" the federation of small businesses said it had been assured by the home office that mr goodwill was only referring to the imminent levy on non-eu workers. a spokesman added: ""the priority for small businesses is to make sure that current eu nationals in the uk workforce are given the right to remain.""   he told the bbc's laura kuenssberg migrants played a valuable role and he was not proposing new restrictions on the rights of people to come to the uk. mr corbyn said labour was not ""wedded"" to freedom of movement, but denied this represented any change of stance on his part. the conservatives accused labour of being ""in chaos"" over immigration. mr corbyn gave several media interviews ahead of a much-publicised speech on brexit, discussing the issue of whether freedom of movement of eu citizens should persist once the uk leaves. in his speech, in peterborough, mr corbyn said he supported ""fair rules"" and ""reasonable management"" of immigration after brexit but said that must be set against continued access to markets for british business. ""labour is not wedded to freedom of movement for eu citizens as a point of principle, but i don't want that to be misinterpreted, nor do we rule it out,"" he said.  ""we cannot afford to lose full access to the european markets on which so many british businesses and jobs depend. ""changes to the way migration rules operate from the eu will be part of the negotiations."" talking to the bbc's political editor, mr corbyn, who has repeatedly insisted since becoming leader that eu migration to the uk is not too high, was asked if the speech meant he had now changed his view.  he replied: ""no. my mind is quite clear that we need to end the exploitation that's going on, we need to maintain a market access within europe and we need to ensure there are good relations between all communities."" mr corbyn said the focus should be on ending the abuse of low-skilled workers under existing eu employment rules and promoting more local recruitment - which he argued would ""probably"" reduce immigration, irrespective of brexit.  analysis by laura kuenssberg, bbc political editor despite the impression given by labour hq overnight that jeremy corbyn was on the point of ditching his long-held backing of the freedom of movement of european citizens - that allows an unlimited number of them to come and live and work in the uk - when push came to shove in interviews this morning, he couldn't quite bring himself to say it. he has not changed his mind on the most basic question when it comes to immigration. does he think that the current levels, with 190,000 eu citizens coming to the uk last year, are too high? ""no."" for many of his supporters, that might be a relief. he has continually defended the rights of people to come to the uk and refused to put a limit on numbers. but for the increasing number of labour mps who have come to believe that the public demands a very different approach, it is a problem. read laura's full blog asked whether he agreed that anyone without a job offer should be barred from coming to the uk, he said: ""we are not saying that anyone could not come here because there would be the right of travel and so on. ""the right to work here would be something that would have to be negotiated."" the labour leader said the ""grotesque exploitation"" of eu migrants by some uk companies had caused ""awful tensions"" in communities because of the under-cutting of wages.  but he defended the role of migrants in helping the nhs and other public services function.  while the uk was definitely leaving the eu, he said it could not ""avoid"" having a close trading relationship with the continent. ""what we don't want to do is turn britain into a bargain-basement economy on the shores of europe where we continuously reduce corporation taxation, encourage a low-wage economy,"" he said.  ""instead what we want is a high-value economy with skilled jobs promoting high-quality exports."" on sunday, theresa may told sky news it would not be possible to hold on to ""bits"" of eu membership after brexit, leading to widespread reporting that she was moving towards leaving the european single market, with restricting immigration a priority. a conservative spokesman said it was clear mr corbyn would not impose any controls on immigration.  ""first he said labour wasn't wedded to freedom of movement, now he says that there are circumstances in which he could keep it,"" he said. liberal democrat leader tim farron said his labour counterpart was ""still no clearer"" on immigration. he added: ""he failed to pull a shift to keep us in the eu before the referendum and now he is helping theresa may, [international trade secretary] liam fox and [foreign secretary] boris johnson yank us out of the single market."" ukip said working families would not be fooled by what they said was a ""load of flannel"".  in his speech, mr corbyn also called for curbs on boardroom pay but appeared to back away from his support earlier in the day for a maximum wage.  he told radio 4 he would personally support a cap on earnings as part of his vision of a more equal country but later said he favoured controlling pay ratios to limit the amount that bosses could earn in relation to their workers.   xavier rolet told the treasury select committee this was needed to protect the uk's financial industry. he agreed that brexit might see a massive migration of city employment to other eu countries, not just a few tens of thousands of jobs. he said the projected two years of brexit negotiation was ""too short"". ""what is required to maintain stability is nothing less than a grandfathering of the existing conditions of trade, for a limited period of time,"" mr rolet said. he said this could be achieved by a five-year transitional deal, maintaining existing business arrangements and regulations, starting from the point at which brexit negotiations were triggered. the committee was hearing evidence about the uk's future economic relationship with the eu. mr rolet was speaking alongside douglas flint, the chairman of hsbc, and elizabeth corley, vice chair of allianz global investors. the mps were told of the fears and concerns of the financial services industry if brexit left it outside the eu's single market and without the ease of trade that comes with it. mr rolet was asked what would happen if the outcome of brexit negotiations was that lse members could no longer handle financial transactions denominated in euros, such as the huge international trade in derivatives between the worlds banks and other financial institutions, which is centred in london. he warned that many tens of thousands of jobs might move from the uk to elsewhere in the eu, because firms, especially foreign ones, currently based in the uk would wish to continue doing business with the rest of europe under existing eu rules. ""without a clear path to continued operation of our global businesses our customers simply would not wait,"" said mr rolet. he added:  ""i'm not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the few thousands.""  ""but the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it's syndication, trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of thousands of jobs. they would then start migrating.""  mr rolet added that such a movement of financial business to other countries would also lead to greater risks to the stability of the international financial system, which might undermine the brexit negotiations themselves. the solution, he suggested, was the policy of ""grandfathering"", whereby the old arrangements were kept in place. ""[this] is likely to strongly support a positive outcome for these [brexit] negotiations,"" he said. mr douglas flint, chairman of the huge international hsbc banking group, told the mps he was worried about a negative outcome of the brexit negotiations for the international banking industry based in london. ""the economic system (in london) is like a jenga tower,"" he said. ""you don't know what will happen if you pull pieces out."" and he explained some of the thinking at big banks behind the decisions they might make in the future. ""there are two risks to jobs. one is we move the jobs, the other is the jobs are simply eliminated because the market opportunity [in europe] is unattractive,"" he said. he added that if the uk's banking industry ended up outside the eu single market, customers would find that it was slower to make payments, and those customers such as smaller businesses would probably have to pay more for the banking services which take place in an almost seamless way today. mr flint told the mps his bank had already started contingency planning for a brexit deal that left the uk outside the eu single market, with france, dublin, amsterdam and luxembourg as likely destinations for banking operations currently based in london. last month a report from the house of lords report warned that any disruption to the uk's financial industry during brexit negotiations might lead to businesses and services moving to new york.   a us-uk trade deal would be a priority, senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker said after meeting foreign secretary boris johnson. barack obama warned in april that the uk would be at the back of the queue for trade deals if voters chose brexit. mr johnson has been meeting with top republicans on capitol hill. ""we hear we are first in line to do a great free trade deal with the united states. so, it's going to be a very exciting year for both our countries,"" he said. those meeting with the foreign secretary included house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. he travelled to washington after meeting with mr trump's senior advisers in new york. a foreign office source told the bbc the talks in washington saw ""seriously positive"" discussions on the prospects for a future us-uk trade deal. mr corker said mr johnson knows ""full well"" that ""there is no way the united kingdom is going to take a back seat"". ""they will take a front seat and i think it will be our priority to make sure that we deal with them on a trade agreement initially but in all respects in a way that demonstrates the long-term friendship that we've had for so long,"" he said. the senator, who had been a leading candidate for secretary of state, said he was sure mr trump would agree with him. mr johnson will not meet mr trump's choice for top diplomat, rex tillerson, while in washington. protocol dictates that cannot happen until the businessman is confirmed as secretary of state. earlier, in new york, the foreign secretary met with mr trump's son-in-law jared kushner, who will serve as a senior adviser in the white house, and his chief strategist, steve bannon. officials said they discussed us foreign policy towards syria, russia and china in ""positive but frank talks"" held hours after mr trump tweeted he was ""very much"" looking forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in the spring. on sunday, mrs may had denounced the president-elect's previous comments about women as ""unacceptable"".  but she also said the relationship between the two countries is about ""something much bigger"" than the relationship between the leaders of their governments.   european legal experts said the uk may still be liable after brexit because of ""concrete"" obligations entered into. professor takis tridimas, from kings college london, said commitments the uk had made under the eu's budgetary system would have to be ""honoured"". the eu's current multi-annual financial framework, which sets a seven-year ceiling on spending, runs until 2020.  this has raised the question of what will happen if the uk leaves in 2019. the uk is expected to begin official brexit negotiations this spring, with the talks scheduled to last two years. ending britain's annual financial contributions to the eu was one of the key arguments during the referendum campaign, with brexit supporters arguing money could be better spent on the nhs and other uk priorities. the uk government has not ruled out voluntarily contributing to remain part of certain eu programmes, such as the student project erasmus or horizon, after brexit.  but the more controversial issue of whether the uk may have to contribute to the eu's budget for a short period after it leaves has yet to be addressed. prof tridimas chair of european law at kings college london, told the lords eu financial affairs sub-committee that the uk had signed up to commitments under the multi-annual financial framework (maff), which was unanimously agreed by member states in 2013, until 2020. while there was no precedent for a member state leaving, he said he believed these commitments were legally binding under existing eu treaties and the terms of the uk's entry into the then european economic community in 1972. however, he said they could potentially be amended in ""unforeseeable circumstances"", if all member states agreed. ""maff can be revised and i think brexit is grounds for revision,"" he told peers. ""but to my mind unanimity will be required to affect it."" pressed by committee chair baroness falkner whether it could be resolved as part of the brexit negotiations, he said there was a ""good possibility"" of a deal. ""it would be wise to have one,"" he said. ""it would be in the interests of both parties and will save a lot of trouble if it were to be achieved."" rhodri thompson, a barrister from matrix chambers, said that the uk may face a ""significant liability"" that could end up being decided by the courts. he told the peers there was likely to be an ""interesting"" political discussion in 2018-9 about whether the question of outstanding payments fell within the jurisdiction of the british courts or the european court of justice.  ""it will raise some rather familiar issues, namely who sets the terms of the deal, who is responsible for interpreting the deal and how much it will cost?"" he said. he raised what he said was the ""golf club analogy"" where a member who cancelled their subscription after a week was told ""tough luck"" by the authorities and asked to pay their dues for the remainder of the period. former cabinet secretary lord butler noted that the eu's annual budgets were agreed separately under the auspices of the maff and that, under the eu's rules, if no agreement was reached in any one year, the budget defaulted to one based on the previous year's agreement. ""if the uk was to withdraw in 2019 as subscriptions stopped, the eu could presumably set a budget without changing the maff,"" he asked. ""suppose there was no agreement on the 2020 budget and one defaulted to... 2019, is there any way the uk could be made liable for its contribution to the 2020 budget?"" prof tridimas said it was ""not unreasonable"" to take the view this might be the case.    the prime minister said she wanted the uk to ""operate within"" the single market as part of a new relationship. speaking in london, she vowed to build a ""shared society"" in which wealth and opportunity were not the preserve of an elite, and injustices were tackled. she said that brexit provided an ""opportunity to fundamentally change britain for the better"".  outlining her social reform agenda in her most significant policy speech for three months, mrs may announced steps to improve mental health provision in the uk and transform attitudes to people suffering from mental health conditions. she announced extra training for teachers, more online self-checking for those with concerns and a review of services for children and teenagers. this approach, she said, was part of her wider belief in a ""shared society"" where the state intervenes to correct social and economic injustices.  speaking to reporters afterwards, she was pressed on market reaction to comments she made on sunday when she suggested the uk could not be expected to ""keep bits"" of its existing eu membership. the pound fell to a two-month low against major currencies on monday, losing about 1% of its value. analysis by laura kuenssberg, bbc political editor after a while, every political leader finds themselves in need of a slogan, and it's certainly not the worst that's ever been dreamed up. theresa may wants you to see her and her party as the sensible middle, on the side of ordinary families, not veering away from the centre ground.  it's about as clear an appeal to middle england, where elections are traditionally won, as you can find. but while she gave today the skeleton of a philosophy, there was not a fully fleshed-out body of policy to accompany it. read laura's full analysis she dismissed claims her comments signalled a preference for a ""hard brexit"" - where the uk would face potential restrictions on trade access and tariffs on exports and imports - to the alternative ""soft brexit"" scenario where the uk remained in the single market but would not have full control over migration. ""i'm tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying 'i'm talking about a hard brexit, (that) it is absolutely inevitable there's a hard brexit',"" she said. ""i don't accept the terms hard and soft brexit. what we're doing is going to get an ambitious, good and best possible deal for the united kingdom in terms of... trading with and operating within the single european market."" german chancellor angela merkel later reiterated that access to the single market would be ""limited"" unless the uk accepted the continued free movement of people from the eu. in response, downing street insisted that discussions over immigration and trade were not a ""zero-sum game"".  expanding on her domestic priorities, mrs may pledged to help those on low and modest incomes who felt bypassed and threatened by globalisation, a group of people who were ""just about managing"" and whose interests had often been neglected by governments over the past 20 years. in what will be seen as break from her predecessor david cameron, she said she backed a ""strong and strategic"" state which could intervene effectively to tackle deep-seated social problems such as educational underachievement and health disparities among certain groups.  ""the central tenet of my belief - the thing that shapes my approach - is that there is more to life than individualism and self-interest,"" she said. ""this means a government rooted not in the laissez-faire liberalism that leaves people to get by on their own, but rather in a new philosophy that means government stepping up. ""not just in the traditional way of providing a welfare state to support the most vulnerable, as vital as that will always be. but actually in going further to help those who have been ignored by government for too long because they don't fall into the income bracket that makes them qualify for welfare support."" she said the 2008 banking crash, the 2009 mps' expenses scandal and the 2011 newspaper phone hacking revelations had led people to question the ""legitimacy"" of institutions and conclude there ""is one rule for the rich and powerful and another for everyone else"". if parties such as the conservatives did not address such concerns, as well as fears over growing levels of inequality and uncontrolled immigration, she warned that groups on the ""fringes"" of the political spectrum would benefit. ""we know what happens when mainstream, centre-ground politics fails,"" she said. ""people embrace the fringe - the politics of division and despair. they turn to those who offer easy answers - who claim to understand people's problems and always know what - and who - to blame.  ""we see those fringe voices gaining prominence in some countries across europe today - voices from the hard-left and the far-right stepping forward and sensing that this is their time."" ""but they stand on the shoulders of mainstream politicians who have allowed unfairness and division to grow by ignoring the legitimate concerns of ordinary people for too long."" labour's shadow minister andrew gywnne said it would ""take more than a speech and a slogan for theresa may to convince people that she wants to tackle division in society"". under the conservatives, he said, ""those at the top have been given tax breaks while everyone else suffers"". lib dem leader tim farron said mrs may's ""pitch to the centre ground"" would not work because ""her words are not matched by her actions"".   phil hogan said: ""our common interest with the uk in many areas has been a defining characteristic of our eu membership to date."" but this would now be an ""enormous mistake"" in brexit negotiations. speaking in two national newspapers on monday, mr hogan also said ""brexit is a mess and getting messier"". writing in the irish times, he said: ""there is a real risk that ireland could allow our relationship with europe to be defined by our relationship with the uk, which would be an enormous mistake in my view.  ""instead, we should have the confidence and direction to recognise that post-brexit ireland will need to have in place a wholly different set of relationships with our eu partners."" he also said the country needed to protect its trading ties with the uk and ""manage how brexit impacts on the island as a whole"". in the irish independent, he warned that if the uk leaves the eu single market then ""a hard border"" with northern ireland looked inevitable.  he said avoiding such a scenario centred on the eu treating the entire island as a special case and single unit. the uk voted to leave the eu by 52% to 48% in june's referendum, though northern ireland voted to remain by a 56% majority.  prime minister theresa may has said she intends to trigger the official process of leaving by the end of march, meaning the uk will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the brexit negotiations.   ruth davidson was speaking the day after the prime minister said the uk could not hold on to ""bits"" of the eu. the brexit debate has largely focused on whether placing controls on the movement of eu citizens will mean the uk has to leave the single market. but ms davidson said free trade was more important to her than immigration.  ms davidson was a vocal supporter of the remain campaign ahead of june's referendum, which saw the uk vote to leave the eu by 52% to 48%, while scottish voters backed remain by 62% to 38%. brexit talks with the eu are expected to begin as early as april - with opposition parties criticising the uk government about a ""lack of clarity"" over what it hopes to achieve.  prime minister theresa may said at the weekend that she would give more details in the coming weeks, while emphasising: ""we will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws."" mrs may added: ""but of course we still want the best possible deal for us, companies to be able to trade, uk companies to be able to trade in and operate within the european union and also european companies to be able to trade with the uk and operate within the uk."" speaking on the bbc's good morning scotland programme, ms davidson said the government was right to take time to listen to people's hopes and concerns about brexit without giving a ""running commentary on every single meeting that you have, and what everybody said"".  when asked what the best possible deal would be, ms davidson said it would be for the whole of the uk to ""have the most amount of free trade within the eu that it is possible"" and an ""an ability outside of the eu to be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries"". she also said that the single market was not a ""binary choice"" between being in or not, with different levels of access possible, and that she wanted the ""largest amount of access"" to the single market. ms davidson said she was ""heartened to hear the prime minister say that she wants uk businesses to have the greatest deal of access and ability to operate within the single market"". and while she said it was important to acknowledge the concerns people have about immigration, she did not regard it as something that was more important than free trade. first minister nicola sturgeon has suggested that a so-called soft brexit - where the uk retains access to the single market - would see the prospect of scottish independence ""put aside"" in the short term. she told the bbc: ""we've put forward very detailed plans about how we avoid a hard brexit and the reason it's important to avoid a hard brexit, let's not forget, is because that will have a devastating impact on our economy and on jobs. so i'm in a sense willing to put aside my preferred option of independence in the eu to see if we can explore a consensus and compromise option."" ms sturgeon has also said she felt mrs may has ""no plan"" for leaving the eu, and said the prime minister was prioritising ""appeasing right-wing brexiteers"" over the uk's national interests. but ms davidson said the snp was desperately trying to ""whip up extra support for independence that hasn't materialised"" by ""trying to exacerbate any differences between the uk government's position and the snp's position"". she added: ""actually, i just don't think that there is a huge amount there, when both the uk government and the scottish government are saying they want the whole uk, and scotland as part of the uk, to have the best trading deals around the world including within the eu."" the tory leader also suggested that her party may rule out coalitions with the snp following may's local government elections, saying: ""i can't imagine there's going to be terribly much appetite to empower the snp."" scottish labour have also questioned ms sturgeon's position over brexit, with leader kezia dugdale telling good morning scotland that ""good faith is fast becoming blind faith"" over the first minister's plans. she said she ""absolutely"" supported scotland's ""ability to have access to the single market"", but argued that ms sturgeon had failed to produce ""real evidence"" of how this could happen if the rest of the uk leaves. the greens have claimed that the rights of scottish people can only be protected if scotland is an ""independent nation within the eu"". meanwhile the scottish lib dems have argued against a second independence referendum, but have called for a vote on the final brexit deal.   speaking outside 10 downing street, he said ""fresh leadership"" was needed. the pm had urged the country to vote remain but was defeated by 52% to 48% despite london, scotland and northern ireland backing staying in. ukip leader nigel farage hailed it as the uk's ""independence day"", while boris johnson said the result would not mean ""pulling up the drawbridge"". scottish first minister nicola sturgeon said she was ""absolutely determined"" to keep scotland in the eu so a second scottish independence referendum was now ""highly likely"". german chancellor angela merkel expressed ""great regret"" at the outcome, and eu chiefs said they expected the uk to begin negotiations to leave ""as soon as possible, however painful that process may be"". but boris johnson, the ex-london mayor and public face of vote leave who is now a front-runner to be next prime minister, said there was ""no need for haste"" about severing the uk's ties. he said voters had ""searched in their hearts"" and the uk now had a ""glorious opportunity"" to pass its own laws, set its own taxes and control its own borders. another leading leave campaigner, labour's gisela stuart, said the uk would be a ""good neighbour"" when it left the eu. the pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985 as the markets reacted to the results.  the slide halted when the bank of england said it stood ready with £250bn of extra funding to ensure market stability.  but the pound remains 8% down against the dollar, and 6% lower against the euro. flanked by his wife samantha, mr cameron announced shortly after 08:15 bst that he had informed the queen of his decision to remain in place for the short term and to then hand over to a new prime minister by the time of the conservative conference in october. he would attempt to ""steady the ship"" over the coming weeks and months, but that it would be for the new prime minister to carry out negotiations with the eu and invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty, which would give the uk two years to negotiate its withdrawal, he said. ""the british people have voted to leave the european union and their will must be respected,"" said mr cameron. ""the will of the british people is an instruction that must be delivered."" area-by-area in maps: see how people voted bank of england governor mark carney said uk banks' ""substantial capital and huge liquidity"" allowed them to continue to lend to businesses and households. chancellor george osborne said he had briefed g7 finance ministers about the consequences of the vote. on twitter, he said it had been a ""hard-fought campaign"" and while it was not the outcome he wanted, ""i will do all i can to make it work"". the referendum turnout was 71.8% - with more than 30 million people voting - the highest turnout at a uk-wide vote since 1992. mr farage - who has campaigned for the past 20 years for britain to leave the eu - told cheering supporters: ""this will be a victory for ordinary people, for decent people."" labour leader jeremy corbyn, who called for the uk to remain in the eu but was accused of a lukewarm campaign, said poorer communities were ""fed up"" with cuts and felt ""marginalised by successive governments"". there have been calls for him to consider his position after some of the strongest votes to leave the eu came from traditional labour heartlands. senior backbencher dame margaret hodge has tabled a motion of no confidence, which has the support of eight other labour mps, urging mr corbyn to resign. the motion could be debated and voted on by labour mps next week. lib dem leader tim farron said labour's leader had been ""utterly gutless"" in the way he approached the campaign. but major unions, which fund the party, have urged labour mps not to create a leadership crisis. shadow chancellor john mcdonnell said his party needed to ""gear up"" for a possible snap election and that he was ""disappointed"" at dame margaret's intervention. saturday monday tuesday wednesday mr johnson and fellow leave campaigner michael gove paid tribute to mr cameron as they addressed vote leave supporters in london alongside ms stuart. mr johnson said the uk was ""no less united... nor indeed any less european"" following the decision to leave the eu. meanwhile, at a press conference in edinburgh, ms sturgeon said a second scottish referendum was ""on the table"" and that the scottish government would prepare legislation to enable one. the european parliament is to hold an emergency session on tuesday to discuss the referendum result. on twitter, eu parliament president martin schulz called for a ""speedy and clear exit negotiation"". mark easton, bbc home editor the eu referendum has revealed an ancient, jagged fault line across the united kingdom. it is a scar that has sliced through conventional politics and traditional social structures, and it is far from clear whether the kingdom can still call itself united. the referendum was ostensibly about membership of the european union. but voters took it to be asking a different question: what kind of country do you want britain to be? yesterday seemed to offer a fork in the road: one path (remain) promised it would lead to a modern world of opportunity based on interdependence; the other (leave) was advertised as a route to an independent land that would respect tradition and heritage. which path people took depended on the prism through which they saw the world. read more from mark britain is set to be the first country to leave the eu since its formation - but the leave vote does not immediately mean britain ceases to be a member of the 28-nation bloc. that process could take a minimum of two years, with leave campaigners suggesting during the referendum campaign that it should not be completed until 2020 - the date of the next scheduled general election. once article 50 has been triggered a country can not rejoin without the consent of all member states. mr cameron previously said he would trigger article 50 as soon as possible after a leave vote but mr johnson and mr gove, who led the campaign to get britain out of the eu, have said he should not rush into it. they also said they wanted to make immediate changes before the uk actually leaves the eu, such as curbing the power of eu judges and limiting the free movement of workers, potentially in breach of the uk's treaty obligations.  the government will also have to negotiate its future trading relationship with the eu and fix trade deals with non-eu countries.  in whitehall and westminster, there will now begin the massive task of unstitching the uk from more than 40 years of eu law, deciding which directives and regulations to keep, amend or ditch. the leave campaign argued during a bitter four-month referendum campaign that the only way britain could ""take back control"" of its own affairs would be to leave the eu. leave dismissed warnings from economists and international bodies about the economic impact of brexit as ""scaremongering"" by a self-serving elite. the cbi said many businesses would be concerned about the referendum result. it said ""the urgent priority now is to reassure the markets"", but warned against ""rushed decisions"".   shares have also been hit. the ftse 100 index began the day by falling more than 8%, then regained some ground to stand 2.5% lower.  the more uk-focused ftse 250 fared even worse, down 8% in early afternoon trading. banks were hard hit, with barclays and rbs falling about 30%, although they later pared losses to below 20%. the ftse 100 ended the day 3.15%  or 199.41 points lower.  the pound's dramatic fall started overnight as the outcome of the referendum became clear. at one stage, it hit $1.3236, a fall of more than 10%. by early afternoon, it had partially recovered, but was still nearly 8% down on the day. as well as the banks, the housebuilding sector was also badly hit, with shares in bovis homes down more than 20% in afternoon trading. ""financials and housebuilders are bearing the brunt of the pain, with lloyds bank being one of the biggest fallers,"" said laith khalaf, senior analyst at hargreaves lansdown, highlighting lloyds' 21% slump. ""it's probably safe to say the public sale of the bank is now firmly in the long grass, and the return to full private ownership of both lloyds and rbs has been knocked off course."" the bank of england said it was ""monitoring developments closely"" and would take ""all necessary steps"" to support monetary stability. in new york, the dow jones fell 2.6%, more than 400 points, in the opening minutes.  brexit reaction: business live brexit: five areas to watch on the economy jack: the great business referendum snub city shock at referendum result uk interest rate 'likely to hit zero' bank of england statement how will brexit affect your finances? property market lull may follow eu vote drivers 'face rising petrol prices' business calls for stability and direction thomas cook halts online currency sales referendum results in full ""this is simply unprecedented, the pound has fallen off a cliff and the ftse is now following suit,"" said dennis de jong, managing director of ufx.com.

""the markets despise uncertainty, yet that is exactly what they're faced with this morning. the shockwaves are likely to reverberate for some time and the warning lights are flashing brighter now than ever."" the ftse 100's initial slump was its biggest one-day fall since the collapse of lehman brothers in october 2008. uk government bond yields hit a new record low, with 10-year yields down more than 30 basis points to 1.018%, according to reuters data.  two-year yields fell more than 20 basis points to their lowest levels since mid-2013, at 0.233%. the impact of the vote was also felt in other european countries. the frankfurt and paris indexes were both down more than 7% and 8% respectively, while the swiss central bank intervened on the money markets to steady the swiss franc after it appreciated in value. oil prices have also fallen sharply in the wake of the referendum outcome, with brent crude down 4.6%. the price of brent crude fell by $2.34 to $48.57 a barrel, its biggest fall since february. at the same time, us crude was down 4.4%, or $2.22, to $47.89 a barrel. before the results started to come in, the pound had risen as high as $1.50, as traders bet on a remain victory. but following early strong leave votes in north-east england, it tumbled to $1.43 and then took another dive after 03:00 bst as leave maintained its lead.  the move in sterling is the biggest one-day fall ever seen. a weaker pound buys fewer dollars or other foreign currencies, which makes it more expensive to buy products from abroad. however, it should benefit exporters as it makes their goods cheaper abroad. against the euro, the pound dropped 7% to about €1.2085. by friday lunchtime, it had risen again but was still 5.3% down on the day. at one point, the euro was 3.3% lower against the dollar, its biggest one-day fall since the currency's inception. currency traders say these moves are more extreme than those seen during the financial crisis of 2008. ""leave's victory has delivered one of the biggest market shocks of all time,"" said joe rundle, head of trading at etx capital.  ""the pound has collapsed to its lowest level in over 30 years, suffering its biggest one-day fall in living memory.  ""panic may not be too strong a word - the pound could have further to go over the next couple of days as markets digest the news.  ""it's fair to say we've never seen anything like it and the chances are markets will remain highly volatile over the coming hours and days."" iag, which owns british airways and iberia, issued a statement saying the result of the vote would hit its profits. ""following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while iag continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015,"" it said. david tinsley at ubs said there would be ""a significant rise in economic uncertainty"" and that the bank of england's monetary policy committee (mpc) was expected to take action, including interest rate cuts and an extension of its quantitative easing programme. ""we expect the mpc will cut policy rates to zero and make further asset purchases, in the first instance of £50-75bn, not later than february 2017,"" he said. in a statement, bank of england governor mark carney said the bank would ""pursue relentlessly"" its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability, which were unchanged. he said the bank had put in place ""extensive contingency plans"" to mitigate the risks associated with the referendum, adding that it stood ready to provide more than £250bn of additional funds to banks through its normal facilities. ""in the coming weeks, the bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses,"" he said. the european central bank (ecb) also issued a statement saying it was closely monitoring financial markets and was in close contact with other central banks. ""the ecb stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies,"" it added. the managing director of the international monetary fund (imf), christine lagarde, said the fund had taken note of the referendum decision. ""we urge the authorities in the uk and europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the uk and the eu, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process,"" she added.  source: bank of new york mellon   but the uk as a whole has voted to leave - raising the prospect of scotland being taken out of the eu against its will.  first minister nicola sturgeon said scotland had delivered a ""strong, unequivocal vote"" to remain in the eu. the result prompted david cameron to announce he would step down as prime minister by october.  speaking in downing street, he said he would ""steady the ship"" until then - but would hand over to a new leader in time for the conservative party conference.  scottish conservative leader ruth davidson said he had served the office of prime minister ""honourably"". she added: ""his decision to remain in post over the short term is the right one, and will help ensure greater stability in the days ahead.  ""it is right that he has already spoken to nicola sturgeon to ensure the scottish government is involved in the negotiations that will follow. ""our two governments need to work together for the benefit of all people in scotland, and they will. all of us need to take stock of this decision, and put the stability of our country first."" us presidential hopeful donald trump, who has arrived in scotland to visit his trump turnberry golf resort, meanwhile said it was a ""great thing"" that the people of the uk had ""taken back their country"". with all the votes declared, the leave side won by a margin of 52% to 48%.  scotland's first minister nicola sturgeon told a media conference a second independence referendum was ""highly likely"" after the uk voted to leave the eu. the snp manifesto for may's holyrood elections said the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was a ""significant and material change"" in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as scotland being taken out of the eu against its will. at a news conference in edinburgh, ms sturgeon said: ""it is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table."" her predecessor as first minister, alex salmond, was quick to suggest there should now be a second scottish independence referendum.  mr salmond told the bbc:  ""it means that nicola sturgeon has to go forward with the manifesto, which as you remember said the scottish parliament should have the right to call a second referendum on scottish independence if there was a material and significant change in the circumstances, like scotland being dragged out of the european union against the will of the scottish people.  ""now that has happened and i'm certain that nicola will go forward on that manifesto commitment."" scottish labour leader kezia dugdale described the result as ""distressing"" but said the priority now was best summed up by the scottish phrase ""keep the heid"". she said: ""first and foremost our priority must be to stabilise the economy - to reassure people about their jobs, about their pensions and about the opportunities that are yet to come. ""it's going to be a long drawn out process now."" scottish liberal democrat leader willie rennie said he was ""angry that we have lost our place in europe"".  he said: ""it is bad for our country and the people who live here. it means cutting our ties with our biggest economic market despite the consequences for trade, business, jobs and incomes. ""it means we are turning our back on co-operating with our closest neighbours on security, peace, the environment and workers' rights."" scottish green co-convenor patrick harvie said scotland ""must keep open every option for protecting ourselves from this threat"" and said it was ""devastating to see that the deceitful, manipulative and at times downright racist brexit campaign has succeeded south of the border"".  tom harris, of scottish vote leave, played down the remain majority in scotland, and said more than a million brexit supporters in scotland had made a ""huge contribution"" to the overall result.  he told bbc scotland's good morning scotland programme: ""it's not the case that scotland voted one way and england voted another. the voice of more than a million scots cannot be simply be dismissed.""  earlier, mr harris predicted there would not be a second independence referendum after the eu result.  the scotland stronger in europe campaign said the scale of the remain majority in scotland was ""exceptional"". spokesman john edward said: ""we are proud that every single local authority area in scotland voted remain with an overall lead of 24 points over leave - that clearly stands out as an exceptional result compared to the rest of the uk.  ""scotland even recorded a higher level of support to stay in the european union than in the 1975 referendum. ""we are pleased to have won well in scotland, but of course the only result that decides the issue is the uk-wide vote."" overall, 1,661,191 voters backed remain in scotland, with 1,018,322 voting for leave.  glasgow voted by 168,335 (67%) to 84,474 (33%) in favour of remain, although turnout was relatively low. edinburgh backed remain by 187,796 (74%) to 64,498 (26%), but results in england and wales were much better for leave. moray saw the closest result in scotland, with remain finishing just 122 votes ahead of leave.  but there were big wins for remain in heavily-populated areas such as aberdeen, dundee, north lanarkshire, south lanarkshire, fife and west lothian.  another day, another constitutional crisis. the final results from the eu referendum weren't even declared before there was discussion of what happens next in scotland. scots have been to the polls five times in the span of just over two years. many may now be wondering if they'll be back again soon. the overbearing theme in the counting halls was one of tension. remain knew they had done well north of the border, but were startled by the strong showing leave recorded in the early results across england and wales. in edinburgh, for example, remain scored a whopping win. but the cheers from the gathered few observers were rather muted, with the national result hanging in the balance. the pattern was repeated across the country - albeit with smaller margins of victory in some places, such as moray, where less than 200 votes separated the sides. and in the end, when the scotland-wide result was announced in grangemouth, it was the leave side who were slapping each other on the back and jumping for joy, despite losing the scottish vote by 62% to 38%. this result will raise a lot more questions than it answers in scotland. orkney became the first scottish area to declare its result at about 00:05, with remain winning 7,189 votes (63%) and leave on 4,193 (37%). turnout was 68.4%.  it was followed by clackmannanshire, which backed remain by 58% to 42%. a majority of voters in shetland, the western isles and the scottish borders also backed remain.  yougov had published an on-the-day poll which had remain on 52% and leave 48%, while an ipsos-mori poll from wednesday and thursday put remain on 54% and leave on 46% - but the pollsters got the result badly wrong, as they had done in last year's general election. about 46.5 million people were registered to vote - including four million in scotland - in what was the third nationwide referendum in uk history.   854,572 (52.5%) voters in wales chose to leave the eu, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) supporting remain. welsh conservative leader and leave supporter andrew rt davies said welsh politics had changed forever but labour's lord hain said there would be ""tragic"" consequences.  david cameron announced he would step down as prime minister by october. first minister carwyn jones has said he fears jobs will be lost in wales following the vote outcome and called for party and public unity in wales. in a statement in downing street he said he would attempt to ""steady the ship"" between now and then. ""we must now prepare for a negotiation with the european union - this will need to involve the full engagement of the scottish, welsh and northern ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our united kingdom are protected and advanced,"" mr cameron said.  the vast bulk of wales' council areas, many of them labour-supporting, voted for leave with a majority in 17 backing brexit. only five areas - gwynedd, cardiff, ceredigion, the vale of glamorgan and monmouthshire - voted for remain. turnout was high at 71.7% for wales. the uk picture eu referendum live: wales votes leave reaction wales results and overnight reaction results in full local results neil hamilton, ukip's assembly group leader, said: ""i am absolutely delighted and i have to admit even a little surprised myself, as i hardly dared believe we could achieve this."" ukip wales leader nathan gill told bbc radio's good morning wales: ""it is wonderful, we [all uk meps] will be given our p45s now. ""it is the 74 meps not the british people who are going to lose their jobs."" he said he was not surprised wales voted to leave and said he had been predicting the outcome for a long time. ""everywhere we have been for two to three years, our support has been galvanising,"" he said. ""people have been telling us they are fed up of the eu, saying it wasn't democratic, saying 'we want our freedom back' and that is what they are going to get."" andrew rt davies said: ""it is clear that the fault lines of welsh politics have now changed forever, and i am extremely proud to have been involved in this campaign."" he told good morning wales that wales will receive more investment outside the european union.  he added: ""i stood by my convictions [backing a leave vote] and stood by my beliefs. we have a great future ahead of us as we are a great trading nation."" as leave campaigners celebrated their historic victory, leading figures from the remain side lined up to warn of ""very serious"" and ""dangerous"" consequences from the decision. lord hain said: ""it is a tragic result for wales which will have serious consequences for us."" speaking to bbc radio's good morning wales, he said: ""what leave voters will find is that they will be pleased in the short-term but in the long-term, the consequences are very serious.  those that voted leave are the ones that benefit most from eu funding."" he said the eu had become ""the whipping boy"", with ""immigration becoming a toxic issue, even in areas where there has been no immigration"". with the potential for scotland to call another independence referendum, he said: ""we could have moved out of one union and lost another in the uk."" he said serious questions must be asked about whether the welsh government's planned m4 relief road and south wales metro project would now happen. simon thomas, a plaid cymru am whose party supported remain, told bbc wales he was extremely disappointed. ""i think its an absolute disaster from the point of view of building the welsh economy over the next five to ten years,"" he said. ""this is very dangerous and disturbing territory that we're entering into."" his fellow plaid am rhun ap iorwerth called the leave vote a ""hammer blow to wales economically"" warning ""the poorest will pay the price"".  ""we have woken up in a deep pit that we have dug ourselves with spades provided by a fear-driven campaign,"" he said. mark williams, welsh liberal democrat leader, said he was deeply disappointed, adding: ""now is not the time for more government infighting at the expense of the people of wales."" labour am and ex-mep baroness morgan said: ""that crash in the market you hear is also the crashing of your pensions. this will impact on everyone."" work and pensions secretary and former welsh secretary stephen crabb said he was ""not surprised"" by the results in wales and voters had not trusted the messages from the remain campaign.  he said voters said they were ""sorry we don't believe what the labour party and the government are saying about the benefits of the european union"". first minister carwyn jones is due to give a press conference at 09:15 bst. political commentator daran hill said: ""wales' decision to leave comes down to a failure of labour and the labour-inclined stronger in campaign to connect with, motivate and mobilise their voters.  ""the welsh voters have done what they haven't done since 1979 - they have rejected the establishment."" live coverage of the results and reaction continues on bbc one wales, on bbc radio wales and radio cymru. we have seen a very surprising pattern. we have seen working class labour voters go fairly solidly ""vote leave"", far more strongly than we were expecting. leave won bridgend - which is first minister carwyn jones' territory - and they won rhondda cynon taff, which is leanne wood's home territory. so maybe it is not the individual politicians we should be looking at - it is actually a question of income and social class more than political affiliation or political leadership. are we looking at a situation where people who felt they have had nothing to lose voted to leave, whereas people who feel they have something to lose - labour or conservative - decided to vote remain? it seems to me that there is an income and class distribution question far more than there is a political one. david cameron and george osborne's big scare campaign did not work and there were issues over the timing of the referendum. because of the assembly election campaign, you only saw carwyn jones and leanne wood together three days before the vote took place. that was far too late to turn their popularity into persuading people to vote to remain.   northern ireland has voted to remain in the eu referendum by a majority of 56% to 44%. however, the uk, as a whole, has voted by a narrow margin to leave the eu. following the result, prime minster david cameron said he would continue for three more months in post, then step down by october. it is up to a new prime minister to start the formal and legal process of leaving the eu, he said. eu referendum results in northern ireland, first minister arlene foster said that as a leader of unionism,  she felt it was the right decision. ""we are now entering a new era of an even stronger united kingdom,"" she said. ""we campaigned to leave the eu.  this is the democratic decision of the people of the uk. this is a uk-wide decision and every vote is equal within the uk. i am proud of the fact that this decision was taken by the people."" the first minister said she would be working for ""the best possible exit negotiation"". mrs foster said a border poll on the reunification of ireland, as called for by sinn féin, would not happen.  ""the secretary of state has already indicated that the test for a border poll has not been met."" she said. in speaking about the future, she added: ""people should not panic. this is something that will take place over a long period of time. i see it as an historic opportunity to build up this nation state again."" northern ireland secretary, theresa villiers, has also ruled out the possibility of a border poll. however deputy first minister martin mcguinness said the entire island of ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. he said there was ""a democratic imperative"" for a border poll.  mr cameron had been ""sleepwalking towards an exit"" over the last year, he said. he accused him of ""kow-towing"" to the right-wing agenda and the ""little englander mentality"". but, he said, the people of northern ireland, both nationalist and unionist, had voted against that. the deputy first minister said the impact in northern ireland would be ""very profound"". ""dragging us out of europe will be to the detriment of all our citizens and will be bad for business, trade, investment, and wider society,"" he said. ""i, and all sinn féin ministers will work to ensure the political institutions remain on a stable footing, but it is very difficult to put detailed contingencies in place until we know the extent of the impact of brexit on our finances, our infrastructure and health services. ""all of that is still subject to a negotiation but the fact is that we are in unchartered waters. ""sinn féin will be seeking an urgent meeting with the irish government, the european institutions and also with our counterparts in scotland to discuss how we move forward in the best interests of all of our people.""  in a statement, the irish government said the result had ""very significant implications for ireland, as well as for britain and for the european union"". the irish taoiseach (prime minister) enda kenny said the dáil (irish parliament) is to be recalled on monday to discuss the impact of brexit on ireland.  ""i am very sorry that the result of the referendum is for the uk to leave the european union. however, the british people have spoken and we fully respect their decision,"" said mr kenny. ""i want to assure the irish public that we have prepared to the greatest extent possible for this eventuality.  those who experienced the ""hard border"" that existed between northern ireland and the republic of ireland during the troubles will shudder at the memory of long queues of traffic as id was checked and vehicles searched. on a bad day, the security checks could add a good hour to a round trip between belfast and dublin. some in the remain camp argued that a vote to exit the european union would see a return of permanent border checkpoints. those in the leave camp, including secretary of state theresa villiers, insisted that was nonsense. read more from vincent here.  ""there will be no immediate change to the free flow of people, goods and services between our islands.""  he also said the dáil would publish a summary of the key actions it will take to address the issues arising from the decision of the british electorate. overall, 440,437 people in northern ireland voted to remain in the eu and 349,442 to leave. out of 18 constituencies, 11 voted to stay in the european union. the turnout in northern ireland was 62.7% with 789,879 people voting in the referendum.  the eu referendum debate divided the parties in northern ireland and the result to leave means there are conflicting thoughts on what should happen next. the dup backed a leave vote and the idea of holding a referendum was a long-term ambition of the party's westminster leader nigel dodds.  first minister arlene foster will be delighted with the result. the remain camp included sinn féin, the uup, the sdlp and the alliance party and they will highlight the fact that a majority of voters in northern ireland bucked the trend, rejecting the arguments for a brexit. sinn féin have called again for a border poll. the party believes the result means there is now a democratic deficit because the rest of the uk is at odds over the issue of europe for secretary of state, theresa villiers, there will be much personal satisfaction with the result. she was a key member of the leave campaign and although she finds herself in tune with public opinion in the rest of the uk, she will be conscious that her stance is at odds with the majority of people in northern ireland. speaking after the result was announced, edwin poots, dup, said he was ""absolutely delighted"".  ""i believe that we will recover very quickly after the initial shock.  the farming community has been in the doldrums... i would expect this will help them. i would expect it will help our manufacturers and our exporters at this time."" at one level nothing has changed. but in reality everything has changed.  northern ireland and the rest of the uk are, for now, still in the eu and its single market: companies still trade under the same system as they did on thursday. but that arrangement will now have to end which could have far reaching economic consequences. read more from john here. he said there was now £10bn that was going to the eu that can now be distributed throughout the uk. however, declan kearney, sinn féin, called it ""a pyrrhic victory"".  ""the reality is that the people of the north of ireland overwhelmingly voted in favour of remain - both republican and unionist, catholic and protestant and those of no faith background,"" he said. ""we now have a situation where english votes are going to drag the will of the people of the north of ireland to remain within the eu, out of the eu. that is a huge democratic deficit. the result of the referendum means significant changes for farming here. but not immediately. the focus now will be on the negotiations for leaving the eu, expected to take at least two years, and what domestic arrangements are arrived at to support agriculture. read more from conor here in northern ireland, foyle, west tyrone, belfast north, belfast south, belfast west, east londonderry, fermanagh and south tyrone, newry and armagh, mid-ulster, north down and south down voted in favour of remain.  lagan valley, north antrim, east antrim, south antrim, strangford, belfast east and upper bann voted to leave.  it is clear this is not the outcome the republic of ireland wanted. the irish government, which remained neutral in the scottish independence referendum, actively encouraged irish citizens in the uk to vote to remain in the eu. read more from shane here meanwhile, google trends has reported a spike in uk searches for ""getting an irish passport"", following the brexit vote. the post office in northern ireland has said it has had an ""unusually high number of people in northern ireland seeking irish passport applications""   while scotland and northern ireland backed staying, every english region except london voted to leave. the england vote was 53.4% for leave and 46.6% for remain. boroughs on or near england's east coast delivered the biggest wins for leave, with boston in lincolnshire recording the highest leave percentage. big cities were split with birmingham, nottingham and sheffield all seeing winning margins for leave of just a few thousand. the church of england said it was now time for the united kingdom to ""re-imagine"" its place in the world. in a joint statement, archbishop of canterbury justin welby and archbishop of york john sentamu said: ""as citizens of the united kingdom, whatever our views during the referendum campaign, we must now unite in a common task to build a generous and forward looking country, contributing to human flourishing around the world.  ""we must remain hospitable and compassionate, builders of bridges and not barriers. many of those living among us and alongside us as neighbours, friends and work colleagues come from overseas and some will feel a deep sense of insecurity. we must respond by offering reassurance, by cherishing our wonderfully diverse society, and by affirming the unique contribution of each and every one."" scottish first minister nicola sturgeon said a second independence referendum north of the border was now ""on the table"" after scotland had been taken out of the eu ""against its will"". derby south mp margaret beckett, a former labour foreign secretary, said she would be ""very, very relieved but really, very surprised"" if the country remained united in five or 10 years' time. boston saw 75.6% of voters back withdrawing from the eu while neighbouring south holland backed leave by 73.6%. boston and skegness conservative mp matt warman, who wanted to remain in the eu, said: ""britain has decided to gamble on brexit - while i personally took the view that it wasn't a risk i wanted to take, i've also said it was one person one vote, and a gamble that could pay off.  ""the government now has a duty to make sure exit negotiations with europe are as painless as possible."" prime minister david cameron announced he will stand down by october. voters in oxfordshire, where he represents the constituency of witney, had backed his pro-remain stance. leave polled 15,188,406 votes while remain had 13,266,996 in england. it meant the majority for leave was 1,921,410 in england, compared with a uk-wide majority of 1,269,501. turnout across england was 73% with 28.4 million ballots cast. chiltern in buckinghamshire had the highest turnout in england - 83.5% - and remain won by 55% to 45%. the lowest turnout was in newham in london where 59.2% of registered voters cast a ballot. nine of the 10 areas with the highest turnouts voted to remain in the eu. the strong support for leaving along the east coast compares with just 21.4% in the london borough of lambeth and 21.5% in hackney. diane abbott, labour mp for hackney, who campaigned for remain, said the vote was a ""a roar of defiance against the westminster elite"". ""we have to listen very carefully to what they were trying to say to us,"" she added. the capital backed remain most strongly in england. hammersmith and fulham council leader, councillor stephen cowan, said he wanted to send a warm message to eu citizens living in the borough. ""we are deeply grateful for the businesses they've started, the hard work they do, and for how our culture has been enriched because they have chosen to live with us in our beautiful corner of west london,"" he said. ""we will do everything we can to ensure all of the borough's eu residents feel as welcome today, and each day thereafter, as they did yesterday."" the referendum exposed deeply divided opinion with several cities coming within a few thousand ballot papers of recording a different result. in leeds 50.3% voted for remain, winning with a majority of just 2,389 votes. birmingham, where labour's most prominent leave campaigner gisela stuart is mp for edgbaston, opted to withdraw by a majority of 0.8%, with 227,251 votes compared with 223,451 for remain. ms stuart said there was a responsibility to act ""in the best long-term interests of this country"". speaking at the electoral commission's main counting centre in manchester, the vote leave chairman said the brexit vote was ""our opportunity to take back control of a whole area of democratic decisions"". all political leaders should now ""reflect on whether they have accurately gauged the people's desire to govern themselves"", she said. the german-born mp said a calm cross-party effort was now needed to implement the voters' decision ""in the best long-term interests of this country"". and she broke into her native tongue to assure other eu nations that britain would remain an ""open, welcoming"" country which would continue to co-operate with its former partners. in cheshire west and chester, part of which is covered by chancellor george osborne's tatton constituency, the result was 50.7% for leave. the result was slightly more pronounced in cheshire east, with 51.2% for leave. former london mayor boris johnson's constituents in uxbridge and south ruislip voted mostly for leave. the constituency comes under the london borough of hillingdon. labour leader jeremy corbyn's constituents in islington voted clearly in favour of remain. reaction to the result has been as divided as the vote itself. dan baker, aged 19, is studying for an undergraduate degree at the university of london institute in paris, and has lived in the french capital for a year. mr baker, originally from doncaster, said: ""i am really disappointed, it's really sad to see england succumb to ignorance. ""i worry about myself living in paris, my life is very european. it makes me wonder if i will be able to stay here if i want to after i have finished my studies."" however, ukip mep for the west midlands james carver said the result showed towns and cities were taking control for themselves. speaking about the birmingham vote going in favour of leave, he said: ""the city of a thousand traders said 'yeah, the world's bigger than the eu'."" the city voted leave by just 3,800 more than remain. conservative leader of the house of commons, chris grayling, stressed the uk would still be on good terms with the eu. the leave campaigner said: ""we need to be an outward facing country, we're going to stay good friends and neighbours with our european partners but we're going to be internationalists, and not little englanders."" tap here to find out how your area voted the local government association, which represents councils, said the government would need to guarantee £5.3bn of funding allocated through eu regeneration programmes up to 2020. a spokesman said: ""eu laws and regulations impact on many council services, such as waste, employment, health and safety, consumer protection and trading and environmental standards.  ""there cannot be an assumption that power over these services is simply transferred from brussels to westminster. if services are delivered locally, then the power over how to run them should rest locally too. decades of centralised control over funding and services has distanced our residents from the decisions that affect their everyday lives. with greater control in our areas we can improve services and save money.""   nicola sturgeon said it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that scotland faced the prospect of being taken out of the eu against its will. she said the scottish government would begin preparing legislation to enable another independence vote. scotland voted in favour of the uk staying in the eu by 62% to 38%.  the uk as a whole has voted to leave, by a margin of 52% to 48%, prompting uk prime minister david cameron to announce he would stand down by october.   the snp manifesto for may's holyrood elections said the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was a ""significant and material change"" in the circumstances that prevailed at the time of the 2014 referendum, such as scotland being taken out of the eu against its will. at a news conference in edinburgh, ms sturgeon said: ""it is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table."" it looks ""highly likely"", says nicola sturgeon, that there will now be a second referendum upon scottish independence.   is she enthused by this prospect? does she thrill at the notion? is she buffing up her best lines from 2014? the answers to those questions would be no, no and, once again, no.  to be clear, for the avoidance of any doubt, nicola sturgeon remains rather keen on the concept of scottish independence. indeed, she yearns for it.   she knows that means another referendum at some point in the future. but not now. not in these circumstances. not in these troubled times.  read more of brian's blog ms sturgeon said the scottish cabinet would meet on saturday and she would make a statement to msps on tuesday.  the first minister said there was now a significant divergence between scotland and the rest of britain which she ""deeply regretted"".  a majority of voters in all 32 council areas in scotland voted remain. area-by-area in maps: see how people voted speaking at her official residence, bute house, she said: ""i intend to take all possible steps and explore all possible options to give effect to how people in scotland voted - in other words to secure our continuing place in the eu, and in the single market in particular."" asked if there were any other options available to the scottish government, she replied: ""i think an independence referendum is now highly likely but i also think it is important that we take time to consider all steps and have the discussions, not least to assess the response of the european union to the vote that scotland expressed yesterday."" she also revealed she had spoken to london mayor sadiq khan since the result and that he shared, for london, the desire to remain in the eu. ""there is clear common cause between us,"" she said.  bbc scotland took to the streets of towns and cities across the country to find out what people felt about the decision to leave the eu. ms sturgeon said: ""after a campaign that has been characterised in the rest of the uk by fear and hate, my priority in the days, weeks and months ahead will be to act at all times in the best interests of scotland and in a way that unites, not divides us.  ""let me be clear about this. whatever happens as a result of this outcome, england, wales and northern ireland will always be scotland's closest neighbours and our best friends - nothing will change that. ""but i want to leave no-one in any doubt about this. i am proud of scotland and how we voted yesterday.  ""we proved that we are a modern, outward looking and inclusive country and we said clearly that we do not want to leave the european union. ""i am determine to do what it takes to make sure these aspirations are realised."" scottish conservative leader ruth davidson said she shared ms sturgeon's disappointment at the result - but she did not believe it justified holding another independence referendum.  in a statement she said: ""like the first minister i want to see stability prioritised in the days ahead. scotland will open for business next week in the same way as it closes today. ""but i do not believe that a second independence referendum will help us achieve that stability nor that it is in the best interests of the people of scotland."" ms davidson added that addressing the challenges of leaving the eu should not mean ""leaving our own union of nations"". she said she believed in scotland's place within the uk ""today as much as ever."" scottish labour leader kezia dugdale said the result was bad for jobs and the economy in scotland and across the uk. she added that she would be ready to work with ms sturgeon in the ""best interests of the people of scotland"". however, ms dugdale said she did not want to see a second scottish independence referendum. she explained: ""on the question of independence, many of the fundamental questions that were unresolved and unanswered in 2014, remain so. not least the question of currency. what we don't need today is more turmoil, more upheaval and more economic chaos.""  secretary of state for scotland, david mundell, said he would meet the scottish government to ensure it was ""fully involved"" in negotiations surrounding the uk's withdrawal from the eu.  responding to suggestions that the result could trigger a second independence referendum, he said now was ""a time for calmness and deliberation, not pushing other personal or political agendas"". scotland's only ukip mep david coburn said it was ""fantastic"" that ""we're out"". he added: ""whatever nonsense nicola is coming out with, all this nonsense of another referendum, another neverendum - she's talking through her hat - because 40% of the population don't want anything to do with the eu."" scottish liberal democrat leader willie rennie said he was ""angry that we have lost our place in europe"".  he said: ""it is bad for our country and the people who live here. it means cutting our ties with our biggest economic market despite the consequences for trade, business, jobs and incomes."" scottish green co-convenor patrick harvie said scotland ""must keep open every option for protecting ourselves from this threat"".   european commission head jean-claude juncker stressed the ""union of the remaining 27 members will continue"". the uk voted by 52% to 48% to leave the eu, and david cameron has announced he will step down as pm by october. he has said it will be up to the new pm to invoke the article that will begin the uk's withdrawal. global stock markets fell heavily on the news of the so-called ""brexit"". the value of the pound has also fallen dramatically. a meeting of 27 eu leaders has been scheduled for wednesday to discuss brexit - but mr cameron is not invited. mr juncker held crisis talks with european parliament president martin schulz, president of the european council donald tusk and dutch pm mark rutte on friday morning. they then released a statement saying they regretted but respected the british decision. they called for the uk ""to give effect to this decision of the british people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty"". they added that the deal agreed with mr cameron in february to protect london's financial markets, curb immigration and opt out of closer union ""ceases to exist"" and ""there will be no renegotiation"". later, mr schulz criticised the decision by mr cameron and his divided conservative party to hold the vote.  ""the european union as a whole was taken as a hostage by a party internal fight of the tories,"" he said. ""and i'm not satisfied today to listen that he wants to step down only in october and once more everything is put on hold until the tories have decided about the next prime minister."" the sense of shock is palpable. eu leaders are struggling to come to terms with a huge setback for those who believe in the idea of european unity. the eu will never be the same again without the uk. it is also clear the leaders want negotiations on a political and economic divorce to move swiftly. that means they want the uk to invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty - the mechanism under which separation will be negotiated - as soon as next week, rather than wait for a new british prime minister in october. in other words, tensions are already coming to the surface. and even though all sides are emphasising the need for co-operation, in many capitals there will be little appetite for doing the uk any favours.  europe's political order has been overturned - with far-reaching consequences that no-one can accurately predict. the uk must now invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty to leave, which then allows for two years for withdrawal to be negotiated. in the latest response:  in pictures: world reacts to brexit ""earthquake"" - what the european papers say 'this was a huge surprise' - europeans react 'significant' consequences for ireland some eu politicians fear a domino effect from brexit that could threaten the whole organisation. polish president andrzej duda said everything possible must be done to prevent other countries leaving. leaders of eurosceptic parties in france, the netherlands and italy quickly demanded referendums in their own countries. reacting to the vote, uk independence party leader nigel farage said ""the eu is dying"". but mr tusk said this was ""not a moment for hysterical reactions"". although many eu leaders expressed shock and dismay at the vote, they also urged solidarity and some stressed the need for change. are you a european with a view on the uk's decision to leave? share your views: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a bbc journalist. you can also contact us in the following ways: if you are happy to be contacted by a bbc journalist please leave a telephone number that we can

""the spanish flag on the rock is much closer than before,"" spain's acting foreign minister jose manuel garcia-margallo said on friday. gibraltar has been a british territory since 1713 but spain continues to claim sovereignty over the enclave. at the entrance to the mediterranean, gibraltar relies heavily on its shared eu border with spain for trade. in a radio interview, mr garcia-margallo said: ""it's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on gibraltar not seen for a very long time.  ""i hope the formula of co-sovereignty - to be clear, the spanish flag on the rock - is much closer than before."" gibraltar's chief minister fabian picardo campaigned for a remain vote.  julie girling, the conservative mep for south west england and gibraltar, said; ""i am deeply sorry that the people of the uk have chosen this leap in the dark.  ""i believe future generations will question our wisdom."" there were 19,322 votes for remain, amid a turnout of 84% of the uk voters on the enclave. spain continues to claim sovereignty over gibraltar but the majority of gibraltarians are british citizens with british passports.  the enclave is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy. it is home to a british military garrison and naval base. gibraltarians elect their own representatives to the territory's house of assembly and the british monarch appoints a governor.    the ukip leader told supporters at a brexit party: ""dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent united kingdom."" with 335 out of 382 results declared, the bbc has forecast a leave win.  the english shires and wales voted for brexit while london, scotland and northern ireland backed a remain vote.  follow the latest developments on our live page mr farage, who has built his political career on campaigning for the uk to leave the eu, had predicted at the start of the night that remain would ""edge"" a win, a view which he said was based on some ""big polling"" done by ""the financial markets"". but by 03:45 bst, he returned to a brexit party in london and told supporters: ""this, if the predictions now are right, this will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people. ""we have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption and deceit. ""and today honesty, decency and belief in nation, i think now is going to win. ""and we will have done it without having to fight, without a single bullet being fired, we'd have done it by damned hard work on the ground."" earlier mr farage, who was not part of the official vote leave campaign, said eurosceptics had long been dismissed as ""fringey"" and ""fruitcakes"" but now: ""the eurosceptic genie is out of the bottle and will not be put back"". speaking at a leave.eu party in central london, he suggested that a late decision to extend the voter registration deadline by 48 hours - after a computer glitch left some people unable to sign up in the final two hours before the original deadline - might play a part in a remain win. it later emerged that more than 430,000 people applied to register to vote during the extension - the bulk of which were aged under 45.  but ukip's sole mp, douglas carswell, appeared to disagree with his party leader.  he said the leave campaign could ""legitimately complain about taxpayer-funded propaganda"" by the pro-remain government but ""when it comes to getting people to engage in a referendum, surely that's a good thing"".   france's national front leader marine le pen said the french must now also have the right to choose. dutch anti-immigration politician geert wilders said the netherlands deserved a ""nexit"" vote while italy's northern league said: ""now it's our turn"". the uk voted by 52% to 48% to leave the eu after 43 years. david cameron has announced he will step down as pm. global stock markets fell heavily on the news and the value of the pound has also fallen dramatically. the european parliament has called a special session for next tuesday. analysts say eu politicians will fear a domino effect from brexit that could threaten the whole organisation. ms le pen hailed the uk vote, placing a union jack flag on her twitter page and tweeting: ""victory for freedom. as i've been saying for years, we must now have the same referendum in france and other eu countries."" she is the front-runner among candidates for the presidential election in 2017 but opinion polls suggest she would lose a run-off vote. the eu worries brexit could reverse 70 years of european integration. in all my years watching european politics, i have never seen such a widespread sense of euroscepticism. plenty of europeans looked on with envy as britain cast its in/out vote. many of the complaints about the eu raised by the leave campaign resonated with voters across the continent. across europe leading eurosceptic politicians queued up this morning to crow about the uk referendum result. but the mood in brussels is deeply gloomy. the brexit vote sends screaming alarm bells, warning that the eu in its current form isn't working. last friday, ms le pen had told a gathering of far-right parties in vienna: ""france has possibly 1,000 more reasons to want to leave the eu than the english."" she said the eu was responsible for high unemployment and failing to keep out ""smugglers, terrorists and economic migrants"". mr wilders, leader of the party for freedom in the netherlands, said in a statement: ""we want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders, and our own immigration policy. ""as quickly as possible the dutch need to get the opportunity to have their say about dutch membership of the european union."" the netherlands faces a general election in march and some opinion polls suggest mr wilders is leading. a recent dutch survey suggested 54% of the people wanted a referendum. mateo salvini, the leader of italy's anti-immigration northern league, tweeted: ""hurrah for the courage of free citizens! heart, brain and pride defeated lies, threats and blackmail.  ""thank you uk, now it's our turn."" the anti-immigration sweden democrats wrote on twitter that ""now we wait for swexit!""  kristian thulesen dahl, leader of the populist danish people's party, said a referendum would be ""a good democratic custom"". european parliament president martin schulz denied brexit would trigger a domino effect, saying the eu was ""well-prepared"". but beatrix von storch, of germany's eurosceptic afd party, praising ""independence day for great britain"", demanded that mr schulz and european commission head jean-claude juncker resign. ""the european union has failed as a political union,"" she said.   but that news - and david cameron's resignation as prime minister - came too late for full coverage in print editions. here is a roundup of what the papers are saying online. the sun calls the referendum result a ""momentous turning point in our history"". ""for the first time in 43 years our nation will stand on its own feet, free from the european union,"" it says. but the guardian's jonathan freedland sees a very different picture. ""for the 48% who voted to remain, and for most of the watching world, britain has changed in a way that makes the heart sink,"" he writes. speaking after the referendum result, mr cameron said he was not the right man to lead britain out of the eu, the times reports. the pm said he would stay for the immediate future but expected his successor to be in place by the conservative party conference in october, it says. the guardian's aditya chakrabortty says mr cameron ""gambled britain and europe's future to shore up his own position"". ""now he has lost his big gamble and he has lost his job - but it will be the rest of the country that pays the price,"" he says. the mail says mr cameron choked back emotion as he delivered the ""bombshell announcement"". voters triggered a ""political earthquake"" by backing brexit, it adds. returning to the referendum result, the telegraph's tim stanley says britain's ""bold, brave, beautiful"" voters ""defied the experts and went with their conscience"". ""we voted the right way because we're a nation with a sense of destiny. the world is ours now. go get it,"" he says. the express quotes ukip leader nigel farage, who calls it britain's ""independence day"". the result has left a ""deeply disunited kingdom"" and ""threatens the breakup of the nation"", the mirror says. it reports that politicians in scotland and northern ireland - where most voters backed remain - have demanded ""breakaway votes"". the referendum result triggered ""financial market turmoil across the globe"" and caused to pound to drop to a 30-year low, the financial times says. the paper also says the vote means the start of ""the world's most complicated divorce"". the bank of england has said it will take ""all necessary steps"" to maintain stability, the express reports. the bank said it was ""monitoring developments closely"" and had done ""extensive contingency planning"" for the event of a brexit vote, the paper adds. there is much discussion of why britain voted for brexit. the daily star says ""huge turnouts in disgruntled labour heartlands in the north and wales"" played a major part. ""huge backing for brexit across the english shires as well as north-eastern towns and cities like sunderland, middlesbrough and hartlepool were boosted by the shock of strong welsh support for leaving the eu,"" the express reports. ""enter, prime minister boris,"" the telegraph says, as it considers possible replacements for mr cameron. it says boris johnson has ""neatly positioned himself"" to become a main player in the leadership race - and points out that he is the bookies' favourite.  but the financial times says the tory leadership system could ""prove tricky for him"", and it quotes an unnamed backbencher who says mr johnson ""lacks support"" among mps. the paper lists stephen crabb, theresa may, nicky morgan, sajid javid and dominic raab as possible contenders.    recorded coverage of the statement in the scottish parliament on the scottish government's proposals for future relations with europe after the uk leaves the european union, from tuesday 20 december. share this with see all episodes from scottish parliament   almost six months after the eu referendum, how much more do we know about what brexit will look like? christian fraser and guests take a detailed look at the issues which will drive the uk's deal. share this with   recorded coverage of shadow brexit secretary keir starmer making a speech in london on the uk's withdrawal from the european union, from tuesday 13 december. share this with see all episodes from briefings   the commons brexit committee's first report urges ministers to publish their brexit plan by mid-february and give parliament a vote on the final deal. jonathan edwards, the committee's only welsh member, accused labour mps of ""gagging"" labour ministers in cardiff. the welsh government said it would work to ensure brexit talks take account of ""the interests of all parts of the uk"". as well as calling for clarity on the brexit plan, the cross-party committee said the uk government should ""strive"" to ensure there was no return to tariffs or other trade barriers. chairman hilary benn said: ""this is going to be a hugely complex task and the outcome will affect us all.  ""the government needs to publish its brexit plan by mid-february at the latest, including its position on membership of the single market and the customs union, so that it can be scrutinised by parliament and the public."" he added that ministers should make it clear that parliament would get a vote on the final deal. mr edwards, mp for carmarthen east and dinefwr, welcomed the committee's support for continued free trade, but was unhappy it would not back his call for the devolved nations to be given a say on the final brexit deal.  ""by blocking my amendments to give wales a voice, the labour mps on the committee have effectively gagged their welsh government colleagues,"" he said.  ""that should ring major alarm bells for us in wales. westminster is intent on turning the uk into a unilateral state, dictating everything from westminster, regardless of the needs and interests of wales."" a welsh government spokesman welcomed the report's support for keeping trade open, and said it was involved in ""ongoing discussions"" with the uk government and other devolved administrations on the approach to brexit. ""this is important work to ensure that the overall uk negotiating position takes into account the interests of all parts of the uk,"" the spokesman said.  ""we look forward to continuing this constructive relationship after article 50 has been triggered."" a uk government spokesman said it welcomed the report, but stressed: ""we will set out our plans, subject to not undermining the uk negotiating position, by the end of march and that parliament will be appropriately engaged throughout the process of exit, abiding by all constitutional and legal obligations that apply."" welsh conservatives leader andrew rt davies said: ""the committee recognises the damage that would be done if the prime minister were to be forced to disclose the government's negotiating position, and that is to be welcomed in what is by and large a sensible report.""   welcome to this new bbc podcast. the first episode will be published within seven days. share this with see all episodes from understanding brexit   recorded coverage of the lords european union select committee session on brexit and the crown dependencies, with evidence from the chief ministers of the isle of man, jersey and guernsey, from tuesday 20 december. share this with see all episodes from select committees   the country has spoken, and the majority of people in wales have voted to leave the eu. but do we really know why? week in, week out travels around wales to find out how the decision divided the nation and asks what next for us post-brexit? share this with see all episodes from week in week out   what impact will the result of the eu referendum vote - whether to remain or leave - have on eu migration?  newsnight comes from the town of boston in lincolnshire, which has one of the highest levels of eu immigration in the country. evan davis is joined by a live audience, politicians on both sides of the argument, a panel of experts, and a group of undecided voters. this is the fourth in a series of newsnight specials looking at the big questions behind the eu referendum. watch them all at bbc.co.uk/newsnight. share this with see all episodes from newsnight   the commons brexit committee said the pm should ""declare her position"" by the middle of february to allow sufficient time for scrutiny. in its first report, it said mps must get a vote on the final deal and backed having an interim deal if needed. in response, the government said its goal was a ""smooth and orderly exit"". the prime minister will give more detail of her objectives in a speech on tuesday. she has said she will formally trigger the process of leaving the eu by the end of march.  once the article 50 process begins, the uk will have two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the eu and outline its future relationship - unless both sides agree to extend the talks. the committee warned that it would be ""unsatisfactory and potentially damaging"" to both sides if the uk left with no agreement and transitional procedures may need to be put in place if it did.  in its debut report, the cross-party select committee on leaving the eu - set up in the wake of last year's brexit vote - made a number of other recommendations, including: under pressure from labour, the snp, plaid cymru and some conservative mps, the government agreed to set out its primary negotiating objectives before the process begins. while not expecting ministers to compromise their negotiating hand, the committee said clear positions on the customs union and the single market were needed. and any economic assessments carried out on the options relating to market membership and access should be made public, it said. the prime minister has rejected suggestions that the uk faces a choice between a ""hard brexit"" - with greater trade flexibility but the prospect of tariffs and customs duties - and a ""soft brexit"" where continued market access would come with obligations to the continued free movement of people and to the european court of justice. eu leaders have said membership of the single market would be incompatible with immigration restrictions, which mrs may has indicated will be a priority. labour mp hilary benn, who chairs the committee, said it would be ""difficult"" to reconcile the two. ""this is going to be a hugely complex task and the outcome will affect us all. the government needs to publish its brexit plan by mid february at the latest, including its position on membership of the single market and the customs union, so that it can be scrutinised by parliament and the public."" negotiations on the uk's divorce terms and the basis of its future relationship with the eu should be conducted at the same time, mr benn said.  as a ""bare minimum"", he said by the time of the uk's departure, a ""clear framework"" for the future of trade with the eu should be in sight.  an interim deal may be required, he added, to avoid the disruption to business of overnight changes to customs procedures, regulatory regimes and immigration rules. several conservative mps have said a transitional deal which continues to bind the uk to eu institutions, even for a limited period, would be unacceptable.  the committee also said the government should give an explicit commitment at an early stage to give mps a vote on the final deal.  businessman john longworth, a key figure within the vote leave campaign, said it was ""absurd"" to presume that transitional arrangements would be needed before discussions had even started. ""provided the prime minister makes clear now the direction of travel; that we are leaving the single market and the customs union, business will have plenty of time to plan,"" he said. the department for exiting the european union said it would strive for the ""best possible"" outcome for the uk. ""we've said we will set out our plans, subject to not undermining the uk negotiating position, by the end of march and that parliament will be appropriately engaged throughout the process of exit, abiding by all constitutional and legal obligations that apply,"" a spokesman said.    malta's prime minister joseph muscat suggested that a transitional trade pact to allow sectors to adapt would mean britain continuing to be bound by judgements from eu courts. but conservative bernard jenkin said such a deal would be ""unacceptable"". mr muscat's government currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu. his comments come after british prime minister theresa may pledged to take the uk out of the jurisdiction of the european court. mrs may, who will deliver a keynote brexit address next tuesday, told last autumn's conservative party conference: ""we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice."" but the maltese premier made clear that any transition trade arrangements, which could last well into the 2020s, would see european institutions retain the upper hand. ""an essential part of those transitional arrangements will be the governing institutions of that period,"" he said, according to the times. ""it is pretty clear to me that the institutions should be the european institutions. ""so it is not a transition period where british institutions take over, but it is a transition period where the european court of justice is still in charge of dishing out judgements."" but mr jenkin, a director of the vote leave campaign and chairman of the influential commons public administration committee, dismissed the maltese prime minister's claims. ""an extended period of transition really is the worst possible scenario for the eu and the uk,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. ""most people want to end the uncertainty and this would be a way of prolonging the uncertainty, which we don't want. ""the choices we're faced with, even if we leave without a deal, substantially, apart from the sort of divorce proceedings, we still get most favoured nation status under wto [world trade organization] rules, which is how we trade with the rest of the world. that's a much better position for us to be in than present membership of the eu, which costs so much and loses so much control."" he also poured scorn on malta's intervention in the brexit debate. ""what you've got is a maltese prime minister who's anxious to scoop for his tiny little island some of the spoils that he believes will fall out of brexit,"" he said. ""most countries aren't in the eu - they are absolutely fine. the biggest transition the eu wants is for us to continue paying into the eu budget for as long as possible. ""they are absolutely paranoid about us leaving because we take away our net contribution, which is a very substantial contribution to the eu budget. ""of course there will be lots of things we'll continue to co-operate with the european union, on defence and security, and foreign policy, which are unconditional - they are not part of the negotiations. ""when you talk to business they want us to get on with this. even most people who were in favour of remaining in the eu have accepted the decision - and they want certainty as quickly as possible."" mr jenkin said it was ""far easier to leave the eu because you don't have to change anything to leave the eu - you just carry all the eu law into our own law and carry on as before"". mrs may, who has said she will trigger article 50 - the formal process for leaving the european union - by april, is under pressure to spell out the government's negotiating stance. but labour leader jeremy corbyn says mrs may is overseeing a ""shambolic tory brexit"".   The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is widely known as Brexit, a portmanteau of ""British"" and ""exit"". Following a referendum held on 23 June 2016 in which 52% of votes cast were in favour of leaving the EU, the UK government intends to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the formal procedure for withdrawing, by the end of March 2017. This, within the treaty terms, would put the UK on a course to leave the EU by March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May, elected by the ruling Conservative Party in the wake of the referendum, has promised a bill to repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and to incorporate existing EU laws into UK domestic law. The terms of withdrawal have not yet been negotiated; in the meantime, the UK remains a full member of the European Union. The UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC), a predecessor of the EU, in 1973, and confirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum by 67% of the votes. Historical opinion polls 1973–2015 tended to reveal majorities in favour of remaining in the EEC, EC or EU. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EEC was advocated mainly by some Labour Party and trade union figures. From the 1990s, withdrawal from the EU was advocated mainly by some Conservatives and by the newly founded UK Independence Party (UKIP).   Brexit (like its early variant, Brixit) is a portmanteau of ""Britain"" and ""exit"". It was derived by analogy from Grexit, referring to a hypothetical withdrawal of Greece from the eurozone (and possibly also the EU). The term Brexit may have first been used in reference to a possible UK withdrawal from the EU by Peter Wilding in a Euractiv blog post on 15 May 2012. The terms ""hard Brexit"" and ""soft Brexit"" are much used unofficially, and are understood to describe the prospective relationship between the UK and the EU after withdrawal, ranging from hard, that could involve the UK trading with the EU like any other non-EU-member country under World Trade Organisation rules but with no obligation to accept free movement of people, to soft, that might involve retaining membership of the EU single market for goods and services and at least some free movement of people, according to European Economic Area rules. Opinion polls taken after EU accession in 1973 until the end of 2015 generally revealed popular British support for EEC or EU membership. Similarly, in the United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum of 1975, two thirds of British voters favoured membership. A clear exception was the year 1980, the first full year of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's term of office, when the highest ever rejection of membership was measured, with 65% opposed to and 26% in favour of membership. After Thatcher had negotiated a rebate of British membership payments in 1984, those favouring the EEC maintained a lead in the opinion polls, except during 2000, as Prime Minister Tony Blair aimed for closer EU integration including adoption of the euro currency, and around 2011, as immigration into the United Kingdom became increasingly noticeable. As late as December 2015 there was, according to ComRes, a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU, albeit with a warning that voter intentions would be considerably influenced by the outcome of Prime Minister David Cameron's ongoing EU reform negotiations, especially with regards to the two issues of ""safeguards for non-Eurozone member states"" and ""immigration"". The following events are relevant. The UK was not a signatory to the Treaty of Rome which created the EEC in 1957. The country subsequently applied to join the organisation in 1963 and again in 1967, but both applications were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, who said that ""a number of aspects of Britain's economy, from working practices to agriculture"" had ""made Britain incompatible with Europe"" and that Britain harboured a ""deep-seated hostility"" to any pan-European project. Once de Gaulle had relinquished the French presidency in 1969, the UK made a third and successful application for membership. The question of sovereignty had been discussed at the time in an official Foreign and Commonwealth Office document (FCO 30/1048) that became open to the public in January 2002 under the rules for availability after thirty years. It listed among ""Areas of policy in which parliamentary freedom to legislate will be affected by entry into the European Communities"": Customs duties, Agriculture, Free movement of labour, services and capital, Transport, and Social Security for migrant workers. The document concluded (paragraph 26) that it was advisable to put the considerations of influence and power before those of formal sovereignty. The Treaty of Accession was signed in January 1972 by the prime minister Edward Heath, leader of the Conservative party. Parliament's European Communities Act 1972 was enacted on 17 October and the UK's instrument of ratification was deposited the next day (18 October), letting the United Kingdom's membership of the EEC, or ""Common Market"", come into effect on 1 January 1973. The opposition Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, contested the October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the EEC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EEC on the new terms. In 1975, the United Kingdom held a referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EEC. All of the major political parties and mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EEC. However, there were significant divides within the ruling Labour party, the membership of which had voted 2:1 in favour of withdrawal at a one-day party conference on 26 April 1974. Since the cabinet was split between strongly pro-European and strongly anti-European ministers, Harold Wilson suspended the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility and allowed ministers to publicly campaign on either side. Seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EEC membership. On 5 June 1975, the electorate were asked to vote yes or no on the question: ""Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?"" Every administrative county in the UK had a majority of ""Yes"", except the Shetland Islands and the Outer Hebrides. With a turnout of 64%, the outcome of the vote was 67.2% in favour of staying in, and the United Kingdom remained a member of the EEC. Support for the UK to leave the EU in 1975, in the data, appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum. In 1979 the United Kingdom opted out of the newly formed European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) which was the precursor to the creation of the euro. The opposition Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EEC without a referendum. It was heavily defeated as the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was re-elected. The Labour Party subsequently changed its policy. In 1985 the United Kingdom ratified the Single European Act, the first major revision to the Treaty of Rome without a referendum with the full support HM Government of Margaret Thatcher. In October 1990 – despite the deep reservations of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher but under pressure from her senior ministers – the United Kingdom joined the ERM with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. In November 1990 Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister amid internal divisions within the Conservative Party arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. In September 1992 the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the ERM after the pound sterling came under pressure from currency speculators (an episode known as Black Wednesday). The resulting cost to UK taxpayers was estimated to be in excess of £3 billion. As a result of the Maastricht Treaty, the EEC became the European Union on 1 November 1993. The new name reflected the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political union. As a result of the Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, the Maastricht Treaty is now known, in updated form as, the Treaty on European Union (2007) or TEU, and the Treaty of Rome is now known, in updated form, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2007) or TFEU. The Referendum Party was formed in 1994 by Sir James Goldsmith to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election and won 810,860 votes, 2.6% of total votes cast. It failed to win a single parliamentary seat as its vote was spread out, losing its deposit (funded by Goldsmith) in 505 constituencies. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was also formed, in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election. UKIP's electoral success in the 2014 European election has been documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. In 2014, UKIP won two by-elections, triggered when the sitting Conservative MPs defected to UKIP and then resigned. These were their first elected MPs. At the 2015 general election UKIP took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014. Euroscepticism is the criticism of and strong opposition to the European Union. Euroscepticism has been increasing according to the NatCen Social Research and its British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey. Since 1983, the BSA survey has been collecting opinions in Europe whether UK should remain or withdraw in the European Union. In the 1990s, the BSA survey offered various choices to the respondents for the Britain's relationship with the European Union. 22% of the respondents agreed with option 1 and 43% with option 2. 65% either desire to break ties or decrease the EU's legislative influence and only 38% support both option 1 and 2. Euroscepticism has been increasing since 1993. In 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron rejected calls for a referendum on the UK's EU membership, but suggested the possibility of a future referendum to gauge public support. According to the BBC, ""The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK's position within the European Union had 'the full-hearted support of the British people' but they needed to show 'tactical and strategic patience'."" Under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, in January 2013, Cameron announced that a Conservative government would hold an in–out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in 2015. The Conservative Party unexpectedly won the 2015 general election with a majority. Soon afterwards the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed European Union and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of ""red tape"", exempting Britain from ""ever-closer union"", and restricting EU immigration. The outcome of the renegotiations was announced in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a country such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council. In a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016 and commented on the renegotiation settlement. Cameron spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a leave vote and of the ""two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit."" The official campaign group for leaving the EU was Vote Leave. Other major campaign groups included Leave.EU, Grassroots Out, Get Britain Out and Better Off Out. The official campaign to stay in the EU, chaired by Stuart Rose, was known as Britain Stronger in Europe, or informally as Remain. Other campaigns supporting remaining in the EU included Conservatives In, Labour in for Britain, #INtogether (Liberal Democrats), Greens for a Better Europe, Scientists for EU, Environmentalists For Europe, Universities for Europe and Another Europe is Possible. The result was announced on the morning of 24 June: 51.9% voted in favour of leaving the European Union and 48.1% voted in favour of remaining a member of the European Union. Comprehensive results are available from the UK Electoral Commission Referendum Results site. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures, but was rejected by the government on 9 July.  After the result was declared, Cameron announced that he would resign by October. He stood down on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister. George Osborne was replaced as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Philip Hammond, Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and David Davis became Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn lost a vote of confidence among his parliamentary party and a leadership challenge was launched, while on 4 July, Nigel Farage announced his resignation as head of UKIP. Outside the UK many Eurosceptic leaders celebrated and expected others to follow the UK example. The right-wing Dutch populist Geert Wilders said that the Netherlands should follow Britain's example and hold a referendum on whether the Netherlands should stay in the European Union. However, opinion polls in the fortnight following the British referendum show that the immediate reaction in the Netherlands and other European countries was a decline in support for Eurosceptic movements. A week after the referendum, Gordon Brown, a former Labour Party leader and the Prime Minister who had signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007, warned of a danger that in the next decade the country would be refighting the referendum. He wrote that remainers were feeling they must be pessimists to prove that Brexit is unmanageable without catastrophe, while leavers optimistically claim economic risks are exaggerated. The previous leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister (1997–2007), Tony Blair, in October 2016 called for a second referendum, a decision through parliament or a general election to decide finally if Britain should leave the EU. Former leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister John Major (1990 to 1997) argued in November 2016 that parliament will have to ratify whatever deal is negotiated and then, depending on the deal there could be a case for a second referendum. As was the case with the 1975 referendum, the 2016 referendum did not directly require the government to do anything in particular. It does not require the government to initiate, or even schedule, the Article 50 procedure. The UK government stated that they would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal, not by a second vote. In a leaflet sent out before the referendum, the UK government stated ""This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.""  Although Cameron stated during the campaign that he would invoke Article 50 straight away in the event of a leave victory, he refused to allow the Civil Service to make any contingency plans, something the Foreign Affairs Select Committee later described as ""an act of gross negligence."" Following the referendum result Cameron announced before the Conservative Party conference that he would resign by October, and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. Quoting the ex-Prime Minister's media release on the UK government's web portal, gov.uk: In the legal case over who has the power to give a notification under Article 50, the Secretary of State did not contend that the Referendum Act 2015 supplied a statutory power for the Crown to give notice under Article 50. The Court observed that he was right not to do so, because any argument to that effect would have been untenable as a matter of statutory interpretation of the 2015 Act and stated: Since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect in December 2009, the process of withdrawal from the European Union has been governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. No member state has ever left the EU. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union provides an invocation procedure whereby a member can notify the European Council and there is a negotiation period of up to two years, after which the treaties cease to apply – although a leaving agreement may be agreed by qualified majority voting. Unless the Council of the European Union unanimously agrees to extensions, the timing for the UK leaving under the article is two years from when the country gives official notice to the EU. The assumption is that new agreements will be negotiated during the two-year window, but there is no legal requirement that agreements have to be made. Some aspects, such as new trade agreements, may be difficult to negotiate until after the UK has formally left the EU. Under Article 50, the withdrawal must be in accordance with the member state's constitution, and uncertainty exists as to the constitutional requirements in the UK. An EU Parliament motion passed on 28 June 2016 called for the UK immediately to trigger Article 50 and start the exit process. There is no mechanism allowing the EU to invoke the article. As long as the UK Government has not invoked Article 50, the UK stays a member of the EU; must continue to fulfil all EU-related treaties, including possible future agreements; and should legally be treated as a member. The EU has no framework to exclude the UK as long as Article 50 is not invoked, and the UK does not violate EU laws. However, if the UK were to breach EU law significantly, there are legal provisions to allow the EU to cancel membership of a state that breaches fundamental EU principles, a test that is hard to pass. These do not allow forced cancellation of membership, only denial of rights such as free trade, free movement and voting rights. Alan Renwick of the Constitution Unit of University College London argues that Article 50 negotiations cannot be used to renegotiate the conditions of future membership and that Article 50 does not provide the legal basis of withdrawing a decision to leave. On the other hand, the constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated that A February 2016 briefing note for the European Parliament stated that a withdrawal from the EU ends, from then on, the application of the EU Treaties in the withdrawing state, although any national acts previously adopted for implementing or transposing EU law would remain valid until amended or repealed, and a withdrawal agreement would need to deal with phasing-out EU financial programmes. The note mentions that a member withdrawing from the EU would need to enact its own new legislation in any field of exclusive EU competence, and that complete isolation of a withdrawing state would be impossible if there is to be a future relationship between the former member and the EU, but that a withdrawal agreement could have transitional provisions for rights deriving from EU citizenship and other rights deriving from EU law that the withdrawal would otherwise extinguish. The Common Fisheries Policy is one of the exclusive competences reserved for the European Union; others concern customs union, competition rules, monetary policy and concluding international agreements. Immediately after the referendum, Cameron declared his belief that the next Prime Minister should activate Article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU. During a 27 June 2016 meeting, the Cabinet decided to establish a unit of civil servants, headed by senior Conservative Oliver Letwin, who would proceed with ""intensive work on the issues that will need to be worked through in order to present options and advice to a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet"". Prime Minister Theresa May made it clear that discussions with the EU would not start in 2016. ""I want to work with ... the European council in a constructive spirit to make this a sensible and orderly departure."" she said. ""All of us will need time to prepare for these negotiations and the United Kingdom will not invoke article 50 until our objectives are clear."" In a joint press conference with May on 20 July 2016, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel supported the UK's position in this respect: ""We all have an interest in this matter being carefully prepared, positions being clearly defined and delineated. I think it is absolutely necessary to have a certain time to prepare for that."" In October 2016 the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced that the government would trigger Article 50 by ""the first quarter of 2017"". Opinions differ on whether Article 50 notification can be given for the United Kingdom by the government exercising the royal prerogative without an explicit Act of Parliament to authorise it. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is unwritten and it operates on convention and legal precedent: this question is without precedent and so the legal position is arguably unclear. A House of Commons briefing paper titled EU Treaty change: the parliamentary process of bills, dated 15 June 2015, stated that, while ratification of international treaties is a matter of royal prerogative, the ratification of treaties amending existing EU treaties is controlled by a requirement for a prior act of Parliament; the paper made no mention of notification of withdrawal from existing treaties. A week after the referendum, a columnist for The Times, David Pannick QC, asked whether parliamentary approval is needed before notification is given of the UK's intention to leave, and answered that an act of parliament is required. The Government argues that the use of prerogative powers to enact the referendum result is constitutionally proper and consistent with domestic law whereas the opposing view is that prerogative powers may not be used to set aside rights previously established by Parliament. Three groups of citizens brought a case before the High Court of England and Wales to challenge the government's interpretation of the law. On 3 November 2016, the court ruled that the UK requires a Parliament vote before formally starting the process to leave the EU. The court described the passing of the European Communities Act 1972 as the major step of ""switching on the direct effect of EU law in the national legal systems"", and reasoned that it is implausible that Parliament's intention was that the Crown should be able to switch it off unilaterally by exercise of its prerogative powers. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has scheduled time in December for hearing an appeal. The circumstances in which the royal prerogative may be used is regarded as of great constitutional significance. Applications of other parties challenging the government in legal proceedings in Northern Ireland's High Court were dismissed on 28 October, but the court was prepared to grant leave to appeal in respect of four out of the five issues. Law officers of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales will be able to take part in the appeal on behalf of their governments. The BBC reported that Scotland's Lord Advocate would be addressing the Court on Scots law and the Welsh Counsel General's submissions would be on the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty. In October 2016, Theresa May promised a ""Great Repeal Bill"", which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in UK law all enactments previously in force under EU law. This bill will be introduced in the May 2017 parliamentary session and enacted before or during the Article 50 negotiations; it would not come into force until the date of exit. It would smooth the transition by ensuring that all laws remain in force until specifically repealed. Such a bill is likely to cause issues constitutionally in terms of the devolution settlements throughout the UK nations. The Scottish Government's approach to the ""Great Repeal Bill"" is that it would require legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament, as it will legislate on Scottish matters. It is also in the Scotland Act 1998 that any legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament has to comply with European Law. Without an alteration to this, Holyrood will still need to follow European Law, or Westminster will likely follow convention to gain legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament to alter this aspect of the Scotland Act. Replying to questions at a parliamentary committee about Parliament's involvement in voting on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU, the Prime Minister said that ""delivering on the vote of the British people to leave the European Union"" was her priority. The opposition shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, commented that the government did not want a vote at the beginning of the process, to trigger Article 50, nor a vote at the end. Various EU leaders have said that they will not start any negotiation before the UK formally invokes Article 50. Jean-Claude Juncker ordered all members of the EU Commission not to engage in any kind of contact with UK parties regarding Brexit. In October 2016, he stated that he was agitated that the British had not developed a sense of community with Europeans during 40 years of membership; Juncker denied that Brexit was a warning for the EU, envisaged developing an EU defence policy without the British after Brexit, and rejected a suggestion that the EC should negotiate in such a way that Britain would be able to hold a second referendum. On 5 November 2016, Juncker reacted to reports of some European businesses seeking to make agreements with the British government, and warned: ""I am telling them  that they should not interfere in the debate, as they will find that I will block their path."" On 29 June, European Council president Donald Tusk told the UK that they would not be allowed access to the European Single Market unless they accepted its four freedoms of movement for goods, capital, services, and people. German foreign secretary Frank-Walter Steinmeier met Britain's foreign secretary Boris Johnson on 4 November 2016; Johnson stressed the importance of British-German relationships, whereas Steinmeier responded that the German view was that the UK should have voted to stay in the EU and that the German priority now was to preserve the remaining union of 27 members. There could be no negotiations before the UK formally gives notice. A long delay before beginning negotiations would be detrimental. Great Britain could not keep the advantages of the common market but at the same time cancel the ""less pleasant rules"". The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, stated that Scotland might refuse consent for legislation required to leave the EU, though some lawyers argue that Scotland cannot block Brexit. Newly appointed PM Theresa May made it clear that negotiations with the EU required a ""UK-wide approach"". On 15 July 2016, she said: ""I have already said that I won't be triggering article 50 until I think that we have a UK approach and objectives for negotiations – I think it is important that we establish that before we trigger article 50."" According to The Daily Telegraph, the Department for Exiting the European Union spent over £250,000 on legal advice from top Government lawyers in two months and has plans to recruit more people. Nick Clegg said the figures showed the Civil Service was unprepared for the very complex negotiations ahead. As a majority of UK voters supported leaving the EU, its subsequent relationship with the remaining EU members could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access to the EU internal market. These include remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) as a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member (alongside Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms more along the Swiss model with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements. Britain has not negotiated a trade agreement since before 1973, and the government is looking to the private sector for assistance. Were the UK to join the EEA as an EFTA member, it would have to sign up to EU internal market legislation without being able to vote on its content, although it would participate in its development. Indeed, the EU is required to conduct extensive consultations with non-EU members beforehand via its many committees and cooperative bodies. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat. The EEA Agreement (EU and EFTA members except Switzerland) does not cover Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies, Customs Union, Common Trade Policy, Common Foreign and Security Policy, direct and indirect taxation, and Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters, leaving EFTA members free to set their own policies in these areas; however, EFTA countries are required to contribute to the EU Budget in exchange for access to the internal market. Under the EEA Agreement, the UK would not be subject to European Court of Justice rulings but instead the EFTA Court would resolve disputes between the EU, EU Member states, and the EFTA Member States. The EEA Agreement and the agreement with Switzerland cover free movement of goods, and free movement of people. Many supporters of Brexit want to restrict freedom of movement; Liechtenstein has successfully used the provisions of Article 114 of the EEA Agreement to restrict free movement of people. Also, an EEA Agreement would include free movement for EU and EEA citizens, as passport systems allow EEA institutions to access markets in EU Member States, for the most part, without having to establish subsidiaries in each EU Member State and incur the costs of full authorisation in those jurisdiction. Others present ideas of a Swiss solution, that is tailor-made agreements between the UK and the EU, but EU representatives have claimed they would not support such a solution. The Swiss agreements contain free movement for EU citizens. (The Swiss immigration referendum, February 2014 voted narrowly in favour of an end to the 'free movement' agreement, by February 2017. However, the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union are all co-dependent: if one is terminated then all are terminated. Consequently, should Switzerland choose unilaterally to cancel the 'free movement' agreement then all its agreements with the EU will lapse unless a compromise is found, compromise reached in December 2016). Several thousand British citizens resident in other EU countries have after the referendum applied for citizenship where they live, since they fear losing the right to work there. Questions have been raised as to whether a state that withdraws from the EU automatically withdraws from the EEA or whether such a withdrawal requires notice under Article 127 of the EEA Agreement – and, if the courts so decide, whether such notice given by the UK would require an act of parliament. A Conservative MEP representing South East England, Daniel Hannan, predicted on BBC Newsnight that immigration from the European Union would not end after Brexit: ""Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed. ... you will look in vain for anything that the Leave campaign said at any point that ever suggested there would ever be any kind of border closure or drawing up of the drawbridge."" In late July 2016, discussions were underway that might provide the UK with an exemption from the EU rules on refugees' freedom of movement for up to seven years. Senior UK government sources confirmed to The Observer that this was ""certainly one of the ideas now on the table"". If the discussions led to an agreement, the UK – though not an EU member – would also retain access to the single market but would be required to pay a significant annual contribution to the EU. According to The Daily Telegraph the news of this possibility caused a rift in the Conservative Party: ""Tory MPs have reacted with fury ....  ... failing to accept the public's decision to sever ties with the 28-member bloc last month."" According to CEP analysis of Labour Force Survey, immigrants in the UK are on average more educated than UK-born citizens. Citizens in the UK are concerned that immigrants are taking over their jobs since most immigrants are highly educated, however, they are actually helping the economy because they too consume goods, and produce jobs. Although immigrants to the UK help to mitigate the negative effects of the ageing British labour force and are believed to have an overall net positive fiscal effect, immigration does also have a dampening effect on wages due to the greater supply of labour. Theresa May believes that if immigration stops there will be no negotiation between the UK and the EU. While the process of dealing with Brexit continues there will be higher security from the UK in regulating who enters the UK, all of this to avoid new immigrants from staying in the UK. However, forecasts indicate that immigration ﬂows to the UK will remain relatively high after Brexit. Prior to the referendum, the UK treasury estimated that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK's trade would be worse off if it left the EU. Supporters of withdrawal from the EU have argued that the cessation of net contributions to the EU would allow for some cuts to taxes and/or increases in government spending. However, Britain would still be required to make contributions to the EU budget if it opted to remain in the European Free Trade Area. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that the majority of forecasts of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy indicate that the government would be left with less money to spend even if it no longer had to pay into the EU. On 15 June 2016, Vote Leave, the official Leave campaign, presented its roadmap to lay out what would happen if Britain left the EU. The blueprint suggested that Parliament would pass laws: Finance Bill to scrap VAT on tampons and household energy bills; Asylum and Immigration Control Bill to end the automatic right of EU citizens to enter Britain; National Health Service (Funding Target) Bill to get an extra 100 million pounds a week; European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill; Free Trade Bill to start to negotiate its own deals with non-EU countries; and European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill to end the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction over Britain and stop making contributions to the EU budget. European experts from the World Pensions Council (WPC) and the University of Bath have argued that, beyond short-lived market volatility, the long term economic prospects of Britain remain high, notably in terms of country attractiveness and foreign direct investment (FDI): ""Country risk experts we spoke to are confident the UK's economy will remain robust in the event of an exit from the EU. 'The economic attractiveness of Britain will not go down and a trade war with London is in no one's interest,' says M Nicolas Firzli, director-general of the World Pensions Council (WPC) and advisory board member for the World Bank Global Infrastructure Facility  Bruce Morley, lecturer in economics at the University of Bath, goes further to suggest that the long-term benefits to the UK of leaving the Union, such as less regulation and more control over Britain's trade policy, could outweigh the short-term uncertainty observed in the  scores."" The mooted importance of the UK’s membership of the EU as a lure for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has long been stressed by supporters of the UK’s continued involvement in the EU. In this view, foreign firms see the UK as a gateway to other EU markets, with the UK economy benefiting from its resulting attractiveness as a location for activity. The UK is certainly a major recipient of FDI. In 2014, it held the second largest stock of inward investment in the world, amounting to just over £1 trillion or almost 7% of the global total. This was more than double the 3% accounted for by Germany and France. On a per capita basis, the UK is the clear front-runner among major economies with a stock of FDI around three times larger than the level in other major European economies and 50% larger than in the US. On 10 August the Institute for Fiscal Studies published a report funded by the Economic and Social Research Council which warned that Britain faced some very difficult choices as it couldn't retain the benefits of full EU membership whilst restricting EU migration. The IFS claimed the cost of reduced economic growth would cost the UK around £70 billion, more than the £8 billion savings in membership fees. It did not expect new trade deals to make up the difference. On 4 October 2016, the Financial Times assessed the potential effect of Brexit on banking. The City of London is world leading in financial services, especially in currency transactions including foreign exchange of euros. This position is enabled by the EU-wide ""passporting"" agreement for financial products. Should the passporting agreement expire in the event of a Brexit, the British financial service industry might lose up to 35,000 of its 1 million jobs, and the Treasury might lose 5 billion pounds annually in tax revenue. Indirect effects could increase these numbers to 71,000 job losses and 10 billion pounds of tax annually. The latter would correspond to about 2% of annual British tax revenue. By July 2016 the Senate of Berlin had sent invitation letters encouraging UK-based start-ups to re-locate to Berlin. According to Anthony Browne of the British Banking Association, many major and minor banks may relocate outside the UK. UK universities rely on the EU for around 16% of their total research funding, and are disproportionately successful at winning EU-awarded research grants. This has raised questions about how such funding would be impacted by a British exit. Jamie L Vernon says that about 1 billion of Britain’s scientific discovery has been paid for by European funding programmes every year and that these resources will now be called into question. “EU officials are calling for an immediate separation, and British academics are already being asked to withdraw from EU-funded projects or to resign from leadership roles”. St George's, University of London professor and UKIP campaigner Angus Dalgleish pointed out that Britain paid much more into the EU research budget than it received, and that existing European collaborations such as CERN and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) began long before the Lisbon Treaty, adding that leaving the EU would not damage Britain's science. London School of Economics emeritus professor (and founder of UKIP) Alan Sked pointed out that non-EU countries such as Israel and Switzerland signed agreements with the EU in terms of the funding of collaborative research and projects. He also suggested that if Britain left the EU, Britain would be able to reach a similar agreement with the EU, and said that educated people and research bodies would easily find some financial arrangement during an at least 2-year transition period which was related to Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union (TEU). The UK government promised that a major type of EU research grant, Horizon 2020 funding, will be funded by the UK for their remaining duration after EU exit for UK researchers. A July 2016 investigation by The Guardian suggested a large number of research projects in a wide range of fields had been hit after the referendum result. They reported that European partners were reluctant to employ British researchers due to uncertainties over funding. The constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated that separate negotiations of the EU institutions with London, Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection. Before the referendum, leading figures with a range of opinions regarding Scottish independence suggested that in the event the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU but Scotland as a whole voted to remain, a second Scottish independence referendum might be precipitated. Former Labour Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish asserted that he would support Scottish independence under such circumstances. In 2013, Scotland exported around three and a half times more to the rest of the UK than to the rest of the EU. The pro-union organisation Scotland in Union has suggested that an independent Scotland within the EU would face trade barriers with a post-Brexit UK and face additional costs for re-entry to the EU. The majority of those living in London and Greater London voted for the UK to remain in the EU. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had spoken to London Mayor Sadiq Khan about the possibility of remaining in the EU and said he shared that objective for London. A petition calling on Khan to declare London independent from the UK received tens of thousands of signatures. Supporters of London's independence argued that London should become a city-state similar to Singapore, while remaining within the EU. Khan admitted that complete independence was unrealistic, but demanded devolving more powers and autonomy for London. In 2015, Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo suggested that Gibraltar would attempt to remain part of the EU in the event the UK voted to leave, but reaffirmed that, regardless of the result, the territory would remain British. In a letter to the UK Foreign Affairs Select Committee, he requested that Gibraltar be considered in negotiations post-Brexit. Spain's foreign minister José García-Margallo said Spain would seek talks on Gibraltar, whose status is disputed, the ""very next day"" after a British exit from the EU. The Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole share, since the 1920s, a Common Travel Area without border controls. According to statements by Theresa May and Enda Kenny, it is intended to maintain this arrangement. After Brexit, in order to prevent illegal migration across the open Northern Irish border into the United Kingdom, the Irish and British governments agreed in October 2016 on a plan whereby British border controls would be applied to Irish ports and airports. This would prevent a ""hard border"" arising between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, this agreement has not been officially ratified and has met opposition by political parties in the Republic of Ireland and there is still great uncertainty in relation to a 'hard border' between the Republic and Northern Ireland. A referendum for the reunification of Ireland was suggested by Sinn Fein’s, Martin McGuinness immediately after the UK EU referendum results were announced. The EU have recently improved borders between EU and non-EU countries due to the recent refugee crisis and if these borders were to be imposed upon Ireland it could disrupt the cross-border relationship that exists at the moment. Creating a border control system between Ireland and Northern Ireland could jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement established in 1998. The Mayor of Saint-Quentin, Xavier Bertrand, stated in February 2016 that ""If Britain leaves Europe, right away the border will leave Calais and go to Dover. We will not continue to guard the border for Britain if it's no longer in the European Union,"" indicating that the juxtaposed controls would end with a leave vote. French Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron also suggested the agreement would be ""threatened"" by a leave vote. These claims have been disputed, as the Le Touquet 2003 treaty enabling juxtaposed controls was not an EU treaty, and would not be legally void upon leaving. After the Brexit vote, Xavier Bertrand asked François Hollande to renegotiate the Touquet agreement, which can be terminated by either party with two years' notice. Hollande rejected the suggestion, and said: ""Calling into question the Touquet deal on the pretext that Britain has voted for Brexit and will have to start negotiations to leave the Union doesn't make sense."" Bernard Cazeneuve, the French Interior Minister, confirmed there would be ""no changes to the accord"". He said: ""The border at Calais is closed and will remain so."" Shortly after the referendum, the German parliament published an analysis on the consequences of a Brexit on the EU and specifically on the economic and political situation of Germany. According to this, Britain is, after the United States and France, the third most important export market for German products. In total Germany exports goods and services to Britain worth about 120 billion euros annually, which is about 8% of German exports, with Germany achieving a trade surplus with Britain worth 36.3 billion euros (2014). Should a ""hard Brexit"" come to pass, the German exports would be subject to WTO customs and tariffs, which would particularly affect German car exports, where duties of about 10% would have to be paid to Britain. In total, 750,000 jobs in Germany depend upon export to Britain, while on the British side about 3 million jobs depend on export to the EU. The study emphasises however that the predictions on the economic effects of a Brexit are subject to significant uncertainty. According to the Lisbon Treaty (2009), EU Council decisions made by qualified majority voting can only be blocked if at least 4 members of the Council form a blocking minority. This rule was originally developed to prevent the three most populous members (Germany, France, Britain) from dominating the EU Council. However, after a Brexit of the economically liberal British, the Germans and like-minded northern European countries (the Dutch, Scandinavians and Balts) would lose an ally and therefore also their blocking minority. Without this blocking minority, other EU states could overrule Germany and its allies in questions of EU budget discipline or the recruitment of German banks to guarantee deposits in troubled southern European banks. With Brexit the EU would lose its second-largest economy, the country with the third-largest population and the financial centre of the world. Furthermore, the EU would lose its second-largest net contributor to the EU budget (2015: Germany 14.3 billion euros, United Kingdom 11.5 billion euros, France 5.5 billion euros). Thus, the departure of Britain would result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors: Germany for example would have to pay an additional 4.5 billion euros for 2019 and again for 2020. In addition the UK would no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, in which only EU members can participate. Britain's share amounts to 16% which Britain would withdraw unless there is an EU treaty change. After a Brexit, the EU would lose its strongest military power including the British nuclear shield, and one of only two members that possess nuclear weapons and have a veto in the Security Council of the United Nations. A report by Tim Oliver of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs expanded analysis of what a British withdrawal could mean for the EU: the report argues a UK withdrawal ""has the potential to fundamentally change the EU and European integration. On the one hand, a withdrawal could tip the EU towards protectionism, exacerbate existing divisions, or unleash centrifugal forces leading to the EU's unravelling. Alternatively, the EU could free itself of its most awkward member, making the EU easier to lead and more effective."" Some authors also highlight the qualitative change in the nature of the EU membership after Brexit: ""What the UK case has clearly shown in our view is that for the Union to be sustainable, membership needs to entail constant caretaking as far as individual members' contributions to the common good are concerned, with both rights and obligations."" As of 15 November 2016 the President of the European Parliament is considering moves to exclude British MEPs from key committee positions ahead of the exit talks. The President has written to the head of the conference of committee chairs asking him to gather information on how Britain’s imminent departure will impact various EU documents passing through the parliament’s committees. Among the issues that should be considered, the letter states, are the possible impact of the British departure on the legislative files currently under discussion in various committees, the impact if the files are not concluded before Britain leaves, and whether any of the files are likely to feature in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. There has been debate about whether other member states will seek to follow Britain's example in leaving the European Union. However it has been argued that most member states have a greater dependence on the EU than Britain, and that the economies of many of the smaller countries would struggle greatly to survive outside of the EU.

        a nobel prize winning economist has compared donald trumpâs âbullyingâ of businesses to the monetary policies of the fascist governments of 1930s europe.â 

edmund phelps told a meeting of the american economic association that the president-electâs âcorporatistâ stance was potentially âdangerousâ for the economy.

mr phelps argued that innovation was key to stimulating the us economy, rather than imposing controls on companies.â

what theresa may and donald trump need to talk about next month



the president-elect has frequently expressed his belief that businesses selling within the us should locate facilities - and therefore employment - within the country. he has threatened to impose heavy tariffs on those which donât and has even disparaged some companies, such as general motors, on twitter, for allegedly planning to move work abroad.â 

general motors lost nearly a quarter of a billion dollarsâ ofâ its stock market value after mr trump's online message.â 

however, mr phelps said âbullyingâ and intervening in companies was âan expansion of corporatist policy of a kind not previously seen since the german and italian economies of the 1930s,â market watch reported.â 

instead of boosting output and employment as mr trump intended, mr phelps said, âif history is a guide, by expanding protection and interference in the business sector, the trump administration may very well block the innovation of outsiders and newcomers more than it would stimulate the innovation among the innovators.â

        india is going to endorse a universal basic income (ubi), according to a leading advocate of the system. â 

the worldâs largest democracy will release a report in january stating that ubi is âbasically the way forward,â according to professor guy standing, who has worked on universal income pilot projects in india.

if implemented, india would join finland in providing free money to citizens.â 

however, prof standing, a founding member of the basic income earth network, didnât believe ubi would be introduced universally across india because of its radical nature.â 



  

elon musk believes universal basic income will follow more automation

under a universal income system, citizens would receive a set amount of money from the state, forfeitingâ other benefits.â 

india, which has an estimated population of 1.3 billion people, has a growing economy but around 29.5 per cent of people live in poverty, according to a 2014 government report ââ particularly in rural areas.â

prof standing told business insider the effects of the ubi trials had been âremarkable positiveâ on their communities, allowing people to have a sense of control over their money, reducing debt and empowering women.â 

""as a consequence of this,â prof standing said, âthe indian government is coming out with a big report in january. as you can imagine that makes me very excited. it will basically say this is the way forward.""

while prof standing said the government report would say ubi was âfeasibleâ he added: ""i don't expect them to go the full way, because it's such a dramatic conversion.â

indiaâs chief economic advisor, arvind subramanian, confirmed in october that the annual economic survey would discuss ubi.â 

mr subramanian has been sympathetic towards the concept of a universal income, telling the indian express: âthe government spends a lot of money on schemes to help the poorâ¦ it is not clear that the money actually reaches the poor. so the question is whether the ubi is a more effective way of reaching the poor that the current schemes that government employs.â

the concept of ubi received a boost recently when the government of finland announced the introduction of a trial involving 2,000 unemployed people.â 

the recipients will be given â¬560 (â£480) every month for two years unconditionally, even if they find work.

in a statement, the finnish government said: âthe primary goal of the basic income experiment is related to promoting employment. the experiment, including follow-up research, aims to find out whether basic income promotes employment.""

however, ubi projects in finland and india -â if it goes ahead - are likely to strongly vary in their scale andâ implementation due to the vast differences in social and economic context. â

        economic factors are not the biggest cause of unhappiness â failed relationships and mental illness play a far greater role, a major new study into the âorigins of happinessâ has found.

eliminating depression and anxiety would reduce misery by 20 per cent, whereas eliminating poverty would only cut it down byâ 5 per cent, social scientists at theâ london school of economicsâ have said, after conducting extensive research into the most effective ways to promote wellbeing and reduce misery.

treating mental illness would involve no net cost to the public purse, the team added, because the economic benefits would exceed the initial costs.

theâ group, led by economist lord richard layard, said they want to ârevolutionise how we think about human prioritiesâ and promote using the âburgeoning new science of âsubjective wellbeingââ as a measure of successful governance, instead of the economy.â â 

âthe evidence shows that the things that matter most for our happiness and for our misery are our social relationships and our mental and physical health,"" said lord layard. ""this demands a new role for the state â not âwealth creationâ but âwellbeing creationâ.â

he added: ""in the past, the state has successively taken on poverty, unemployment, education and physical health.

but equally important now are domestic violence, alcoholism, depression and anxiety conditions, alienated youth, exam-mania and much else. these should become centre stage.â

although living standards have vastly improved in the last forty years, levels of enjoyment from life have stayed static for people in australia, germany, the us, and the uk, the team said, as they prepared to present their findings for the first time at an oecd co-organised conference on wellbeing, which will be held at the lse on monday and tuesday.



  

warwick university suggests happiness is genetically predetermined - london live

when people evaluate their income or education, they generally measure it against the prevailing local norm, the study found,â as a result, overall increases in income or education have little effect on the overall happiness of the population.â 

in fact, income inequality explains only one per cent of the variation in happiness in the community, while mental health differences explain over four per cent.

other key findings included education only having a very small effect on life satisfaction, compared with, for example, having a partner.

the strongest factor predicting a happy adult life is not childrenâs qualifications but their emotional health, the researchers said, criticisingâ âexam-maniaâ and asking:â âhow on earth did so many policy-makers come to believe that qualifications were the be-all and end-all â âin the interests of the childâ?

local authorities 'spend close to nothing on mental health'



school is extremely important, the study found, but not in terms of reaping academic rewards, instead because of the relative emphasis different schools put on the happiness and wellbeing of their pupils.

they group said they hoped the conference wouldâ facilitate a shift in strategy at the top, towards prioritising wellbeing. the study aims toâ provideâ a way to measure wellbeing, and suggestâ means by which to improve it.

âhuman capital took off once people realised its high rate of return,â the report said. âwellbeing will only take off when policy-makers have numbers that tell them how any change of policy will affect the measured wellbeing of the people, and at what cost.â

investing in wellbeing is a good tactic forâ politicians, they pointed out;â in european elections since 1970 the life satisfaction of the people is the best predictor of whether the government gets re-elected â much more important than economic growth, unemployment or inflation.

investigating the most effective way to improve overall wellbeing, the team recommendedâ that mental illness was an enormous factor in unhappiness, especially among the least happy 10 per cent, and should be immediately addressed. they suggested an expansion of existing schemes, in addition to new measures.

âsince 2008, britainâs national health service has developed a nationwide service with different local names but known generically as improving access to psychological therapies (iapt).â this programme now treats over half a million people with depression or anxiety disorders annually, of whom 50 per cent recover during treatment,â the report said. âbecause of financial flowbacks, we believe that in fact it costs the government nothing.ââ

it added politicians should invest in preventative measures, suggesting âa four-year curriculum called healthy minds, one lesson a week. this too has very low costs since children are already spending an hour a week on life skills lessons of unknown, but probably, low effectivenessâ.â 

nancy hey, director of what works centre for wellbeing, emphasised how useful the study could be.

âmost people are convinced that improving wellbeing is important and that there is a need to act. what is trickier is understanding what organisations â government, business, communities â can do,"" she said.

""this world-leading research helps us understand what really supports people to live better lives. these findings can be used to inform policy and spending decisions, and i hope will lead to trials that continue to build the global evidence base of what works to improve wellbeing.""

        the first thing to look for this week will be the reaction to the story of working conditions in the amazon warehouse in dunfermline â of people sleeping in tents by the side of the roadâ so they can get to work on time. people will have their own views about this, and the revelations are troubling. but if you step back from the facts of theâ story itself, there is something to watch for. it will be whether there is any damage to amazonâs business.â 

no-one needs to buy from amazon. the experience of other us giant corporations in the uk that find themselves facing adverse publicity â for example, over tax â is to meet the challenge at least halfâ way. there have been earlier stories about working practices in the company,â but these seem to have had little or no impact on the business.

what will amazon do? if there is damage, expect change. and if not â¦ well, its policies will have been tacitly accepted by its customers.

this is part of a wider concern. the labour mp, frank field, has just published a report on the conditions of uber drivers, having interviewed 83 of them. the report, co-authored with his researcher andrew forsey, cites four aspects of working with uber which it says âbear a close resemblance with what the victorians would have called sweated labourâ. these are the low pay, difficulty in finding enough work, lack of emergency support, and lack of freedom of when to work. again, these criticisms are not new, and regulation will eventually catch up â as it did when the mini-cab industry grew up alongside the regulated taxi one. meanwhile customers can take direct action by not using the service. â 



  

is amazon spreading itself too thin?

secondly, there will be a huge story about the rise in us interest rates. the federal reserve will announce an increase of 0.25 per cent on thursday. if it does not there will be an even bigger story, for the rise is completely expected by the markets. as always, though, the reaction will be as important as the actuality, in particular what happens to longer-term rates. if these rise sharply, this will feed through into other markets, including our own. already some of the very cheap mortgage deals in the uk are being withdrawn. whatever the bank of england does, expect more expensive home loans.

there will also be a clutch of uk economic data this week that will help us see the impact, or not, of brexit. among these, there will be consumer price indices on tuesday, labour market figures on wednesday, and retail sales on thursday. i expect there will be very little showing through yet from the brexit vote, and that prices will remain contained, unemployment still falling and retail sales strong. but ââ a big but ââ if weakness is evident, that will be seen as a negative signal for the economy next year.

fourth, there is the italian banking system. there is an immediate issue as to how monte dei paschi di siena will be propped up, for the european central bank last week refused to give more time for a rescue. so something has to be done this week. but behind this is the wider weakness of the whole banking system. the danger is that there will be some sort of systemicâ collapse akin to that of 2008.

finally, iâm interested in a court case. no, not one to so with brexit, but rather to do with christine lagarde, managing director of the imf. she is on trial in france this week on charges of negligence, accused of failing to prevent a government payout to the businessman bernard tapie eight years ago. she was franceâs finance minister at the time. she denies the charges, and some see them as political in nature. the verdict could come this week. if it goes against her that would be a blow to the imf, for though it has nothing to do with her present job, the penalties could include a jail sentence, which would prevent her continuing there.â

        in this age of populist revolt over the arrogance of âelitesâ the case brought by faiz siddiqui against oxford university feels like some fake news generated in a propaganda bunker in order to fire up the gullible masses.

yet you couldnât, as they say, make it up. siddiqui really is claiming at the high court that some ânegligentâ teaching he received while reading history at brasenose college some 16 years ago prevented him taking a first class degree.

and that academic body blow, in turn, he argues, meant he never embarked on a lucrative career as a commercial barrister. siddiqui feels oxford should now stump up â£1m to compensate him for the earnings he would, he believes, have raked in over that period as a hot shot lawyer.

you donât have to be a member of the angry populist vanguard to feel irritated by siddiquiâs claim â and most of us will probably be hoping the court tells him were he can lodge his â£1m damages claim.â yet, at the same time, itâs worth recognising that thereâs an important economic theory embedded in siddiquiâs argument: path dependency.

this is the idea that initial conditions, and small differences in those initial conditions, can, over time, have a significant impact on how things work out.

think of the position of english as the universal language of global business. english protestant non-conformists were the dominant european group who colonised the americas in the 17th century, and after independence english thus became the language of the young united states.

when the united states emerged as the pre-eminent global economic and military power of the western world in the twentieth century that made english the new global âlingua francaâ.

what if the dominant group among the american colonisers had been dutch or french? then itâs entirely possible that the global language of commerce today would be the mother tongue of geert wilders or francois hollande.

similarly, why does almost every computer keyboard in the western world use a âqwertyâ letter configuration? â there are many other possible configurations, ones more efficient for transcribing many of the worldâs languages. the answer is that qwerty was the layout used for the remington no.1, the worldâs first commercially successful typewriter designed by latham sholes and carlos glidden in new york in the 1870s.

there is a mental health crisis in the city



people got used to the configuration early on. and as technology progressed, from typewriters to personal computers, manufacturers never changed it. and now most of the world uses qwerty, they probably never will â at least for as long as we use keyboards to input data. but if sholes and glidden had used a different keyboard layout for the remington a century and a half ago i might be tapping out this article today on a keyboard using an entirely different array of finger patterns.

when industries, by historical accident, take root in a certain location they can sometimes be immovable. a network of ancillary firms spring up in the same location to service the core industry, making it a no-brainer for other new industry players to establish themselves there too.

path dependency helps explains why hollywood is the global capital of the film industry and why the city of london is the pre-eminent global financial hub. in the latter case, weâll see whether brexit is a big enough shock to change it. people who are confident that the city will survive are using path dependent logic.

this is the argument siddiquiâs lawyers presumably seek to make too. those boring tutorials adversely affected the initial conditions of his adult life â and his career was on a less lucrative path ever after.



  

trump protester attacked at ohio state university

this is similar to the plot of the tragic late 1990s rom-com sliding doors where, through movie magic, the life of the gwyneth paltrow'sâ character is shown simultaneously taking dramatically different courses based on whether or not she managed to jump on a specific tube train before the doors closed.

but unfortunately for siddiqui it wonât be easy to make that case in economic terms, let alone legal ones. the two key factors behind path dependence in economic and social systems are positive feedback and network effects â people adopt a system, or standard, or location, because enough other people have done so and this creates a self-reinforcing cycle, which leads to exponential growth and compounding success.

yet siddiquiâs life and career is not a âsystemâ in itself, but a small component of larger ones. and this is, in fact, the likely source of the irritation that his claim provokes. the mere fact that siddiqui made it to oxford is evidence that he was already part of a powerful and privileged network created by a path dependent process â one that confers advantages in terms of skills and social connections that most people, some of them equally talented and hardworking, never had.

the powerful economic force of path dependency had already worked in siddiquiâs favour. for him to then blame it for not delivering him the full financial rewards to which he felt entitled is almost as rich as the alternative career siddiqui imagines he would have enjoyed.

        activists and investors are clubbing together to run a $10m trial of universal basic income in the united states.

the economic security project will run for two years in an attempt to discover whether guaranteed minimum cash payments are the key to solving problems like poverty or the stagnation of the middle class.

individuals and non-profit organisations, including technologists, academics and artists, will receive money to ""explore and experiment with cash-related work"", according to the project.

a canadian province recently voted in favour of trialling a universal basic income for its citizens in partnership with the national government.

peter bevan baker, green party leader in prince edward island, proposed the bill.

he said: ""a universal basic income could enable the greatest unleashing of human potential ever seen.""

        is everyone too gloomy about the world economy, and indeed the british one too? after a tumultuous week, with the us coming to terms with a shift in economic policy (and much more) and the uk counting the potential cost of brexit, this should be a week for reflection. second thoughts are usually better than first ones.

as far as the uk is concerned, the most interesting thing to look for will be how the economic forecasts for 2017 are shaping up. the official view, that of both the bank of england and the office for budget responsibility, is that growth will be around 1.4 per cent. the obr took some stick for that last week, unfairly because the whole point of having an independent office is that it should be independent of political pressure, and it was doing just that. in any case that forecast was at the top end of the present expected scale.

is italy about to feel the trump effect?



the question now is whether other forecasters will start to revise their forecasts upwards, given the loosening of policy in the us (which should, in the short term, boost growth there). at the margin that should benefit the uk. a bigger influence, however, will be a more general rethinking of the behaviour of uk consumers, which have kept the economy growing solidly though the second half of this year. if they keep going next year, maybe growth forecasts should be revised up for 2017, just as they have for 2016. we should start to see the new private sector forecasts for 2017 starting to come through in the next few days.

next, there are some purchasing managersâ indices or pmis, coming out this week. these, you will remember, give an indication of the optimism/pessimism of the business community and hence of future growth. on thursday we get the uk ones for manufacturing and on friday for construction. we have to wait until the following monday for the all-important services sector. expect a gradual, cautious recovery. but â more important â on thursday we get world-wide pmis for manufacturing. that will tell us about the world, which is of course matters vastly more. global recession next year? not if global pmis remain positive.

third, also on thursday, come the eurozone unemployment figures. these vary greatly across the region but the sad truth is that since august 2009 there has been only one month (april 2010) when unemployment has dipped below 10 per cent. they may dip below this week. unemployment is a lagging indicator, but given the modest but continuing recovery in the eurozone, this will be taken as a sign of welcome confidence.

there will also be a huge amount of new information about social change in britain coming from the office for national statistics. on tuesday we learn about changes in life expectancy in different parts of the uk, on births by age of mother and father, as well as activity in the low carbon economy. on wednesday, among other info, there will be calculations on the natural stock of the country â how our physical resources are shifting. on thursday there are new estimates of migration up to 2015. expect these to attract a lot of attention for obvious reasons. and on friday there will be statistics on suicides.

finally, something coming up at the end of the week, next sunday, the italian referendum. this matters massively, not so much for the specific issue, to approve constitutional changes, but rather because it is a vote of confidence in the government. given the difficulties of the italian economy of near-zero growth over the past 15 years and the weakness of the banking system, this could trigger a strong adverse reaction if the vote turns out to be no.â

        fidel castroâs economic legacy will be one of failure â but not perhaps quite as catastrophic a failure as his many detractors would insist. the cuba of the 1950s was not some sort of golden age, for though officially the country was as rich as italy in terms of gdp per head, that wealth was unevenly distributed and some 40 per cent of the population did not have proper jobs. for the rich it might indeed have seemed a paradise, but for the majority public services such as health and education were poor or non-existent and life was extremely tough. that, after all, was why castroâs revolution had such popular support.

when he took power in 1959, fidel castro chose, or was pushed, into conflict with its largest export market, the united states. the distant soviet union could buy cubaâs principal export, sugar, at guaranteed prices. it could give other forms of economic and technical aid. but it also helped seduce the fledgling revolutionary leaders into imposing a command economy rather than a market-driven one.

in reality cuba had little choice but to follow the economic model of its new benefactor, and to reject that of the west. in the context of the cold war this did not seem as odd a course as it does now. many economists at the time believed that the soviet command economy could at least be a match for western market economies in terms of overall growth, and had the further advantage of a fairer distribution of income. it was after all another 30 years before the soviet union itself collapsed, and its economic system with it.



  

cubans around the world react to death of fidel castro

in the 1960s and 1970s cuba seemed, on the face of it, to be making good progress. universal education was brought in, the famous health service became a beacon for the region, and living standards for the majority of the population crept upwards. cuba remained one of the richest countries in the caribbean. but a dark cloud hung over these achievements. cubans wanted, in their thousands, to leave. many died attempting to do so. cuba had bought into the soviet unionâs economic system, but like the european satellites, it could only stop its people from choosing the westâs economic system by forcing them to stay.

defending fidel castroâs economic management became even harder after the collapse of the soviet empire at the end of the 1980s. subsidies stopped. russia no long took the sugar crop at guaranteed prices. gdp fell by one-third in the early 1990s. there was famine â though there is a debate as to just how desperate that was. the response of the regime was to liberalise the economy in modest ways. us dollars became legal tender for a while. farmers were allowed to sell any surplus over and above their official quotas. tourism was encouraged. some modern foreign cars were imported, enabling the battered 1950s american vehicles to be retired.

things recovered a bit. fidel castro himself acknowledged that there had been mistakes. but â and this shows his narrowness of vision â as the economy improved through the late 1990s and early 2000s, many controls were re-imposed. pursuing the revolutionary purity of a command economy was more important than allowing people to have higher living standards.

since he stepped aside for health reasons, allowing his brother raãºl castroâ to take charge, there has been a gradual loosening of economic controls. from 2008 ordinary people were allowed to have mobile phones. for anyone outside cuba it seems amazing that people did not have mobiles before that.

as a result of the reforms led by raãºl castro, the economy has boomed. and that, in a way, points to the saddest element of his brotherâs economic legacy. you can understand in the context of the revolution and the us response that cuba would head down the command economy path. but to persist after the collapse of communism in an economic system that was proven not to work, to make reforms then reverse them, shows not only a lack of any comprehension about economics but huge arrogance in the face of hard evidence. it took the quiet orderly approach of raãºl castro to demonstrate the failings of his more charismatic brother.

        it is hard to compare donald trump to anyone else in american politics, especially when it comes to the economy. the president-elect plans to combine restrictions on goods imported from abroad, which are usually advocated by liberal politicians, with conventionally republican policies, such as tax relief for the wealthy and major corporations, along with more federal borrowing.

more than any u.s. politician's platform, trump's agenda on the economy resembles those of populist leaders abroad. in particular, the policies he has proposed are very similar to those of dilma rousseff, the former president of brazil who was ousted from office in august.

as trump has planned to do, rousseff enforced restrictions on imports. she promised new spending on infrastructure and granted generous subsidies to corporations with the goal of stimulating the economy, especially manufacturing.

âitâs a very similar program,â said riordan roett, a political scientist at johns hopkins university and an expert on latin america.

while there are a number of important differences between the brazilian and u.s. economies, rousseff's policies arguably offer a cautionary example for newly empowered republicans in washington. the brazilian economy is in a severe and persistent recession. gross domestic product contracted 3.8 percent last year, according to the international monetary fund, which projects a decline of 3.3 percent this year.

inflation accelerated to an annual pace of 10.6 percent earlier this year, according to the central bank of brazil, and while prices are not increasing as fast as they were, the unemployment rate has climbed to 11.8 percent as of last quarter.

âthe challenges are pretty massive,â said monica de bolle, an economist and roett's colleague at johns hopkins, who has written about the similarities between trump and rousseff.

âit was a combination of protectionism and fiscal expansion,â said de bolle, who is also a fellow at the peterson institute for international economics. ânow the day of reckoning has come.â

the economy was expanding at a rapid pace of 7.5 percent in 2010, the year before rousseff took office. exports to the global commodity market were helping to sustain the expansion and to pay for the populist agenda of rousseff's predecessor, luiz inã¡cio lula da silva, also of the leftist workers' party.

rousseff built on his policies. her administration continued extending cheap credit to major brazilian firms through the government's development bank. these costly subsidies, combined with other tax credits, contributed to an increasing deficit. so did a decline in prices for commodities worldwide.

under lula, the brazilian government's revenue exceeded new spending (excluding payments on interest) by about 3 percent a year. the government's finances have reversed under rousseff, with spending exceeding revenue. fitch, moody's and standard & poor's now rate brazil's debt as junk, indicating that investors who have loaned the government money might not be paid back.

lula and rousseff also favored local labor and domestically produced goods and services by, for instance, requiring companies bidding for fossil-fuel rights to rely on equipment manufactured in brazil.

last year, rousseff announced $64 billion in new infrastructure expenditures. while few projects came to fruition, her plan, like the one trump's economic advisers put forward last month, depended on collaboration with the private sector to provide financing.

the brazilian left praises rousseff for her efforts on behalf of organized labor and her ambitious programs to reduce poverty. de bolle, however, argues that the rousseff administration's policies for major brazilian firms and manufacturers were more significant economically.

âthe fact is that the dilma government was much more generous to the rich than it was to the poor,â de bolle says, calling rousseff's approach âvery trump-like.â

she and other observers say that the combination of deficits and protectionist policy combined with the decline in prices for brazil's exports to produce a serious slump.

protectionist rules may have restricted the supply of goods, raising costs for consumers. meanwhile, the government's debts had put the country in a vulnerable position, with interest absorbing more of the economy.

these constraints might be less of a problem for the united states if trump pursues similar policies. the u.s. economy is better diversified than brazil's and less dependent on exports, so while the bust in commodities was a real problem for brazil, the united states would be more resilient.

additionally, investors around the world see the federal government as a dependable borrower, so trump will have more capacity to issue treasury bonds without forcing up interest rates.

meanwhile, many economists argue that a modest increase in federal spending could stimulate the u.s. economy without causing excessive inflation. de bolle describes âa scenario where a trump administration is actually able to do a sensible fiscal expansion, something that is more in line with what the country needs right now, without that actually unhinging the fiscal accounts going forward in the way that populist policies usually do.â

for their part, trump and his economic advisers have argued that their plans will not burden the federal budget, promising that new investments in infrastructure and tax relief will be balanced by reductions in spending on other programs.

whether investors believe this promise is unclear from the turmoil in bond markets since the election. they are demanding greater payments in exchange for holding the federal government's debt.

yields on 10-year and 30-year treasury notes have skyrocketed roughly 40 basis points, or 0.4 percentage points, since the election. that could be because investors expect trump's policies to benefit the economy and they would rather put their money in stocks and other securities that will be more profitable than treasury bonds during a boom. it could also be that investors expect inflation will erode the value of the bonds they hold today and are demanding compensation.

de bolle said those climbing yields spelled more trouble for brazil. costlier yields mean that the government will have to pay lenders more for new loans to make good on the debts it has already accumulated.

that will be a challenge for president michel temer, who took office after rousseff was forced out amid a scandal. her supporters argue that allegations of corruption against her were politically motivated, and that her impeachment trial and removal from office amounted to an undemocratic coup.

        we were warned that were donald trump to become the president-elect, the financial markets would crash. shares would slide; the dollar would plunge. markets like stability and the one thing that his friends and foes would agree on is that the donald would not bring stability. he promised many things, but continuity of policy was not one.

as we now know, these market predictions have been completely wrong. the dow jones reached a new peak last week and the dollar is at a 13-year high. sure, bond yields rose, but under any other circumstances this would have been welcomed as a sign of a return to more normal financial conditions. in any case, they are still lower than they were a year ago.

so does this mean that finance has fallen in love with trumponomics?

well, perhaps not yet. no one knows much about it. we donât yet have a treasury secretary or any other financial appointments. we donât know what bits of candidate trumpâs policy calls might be hardened into specific policy proposals. we donât know what he could get through congress. but â and this is a big but â there is a shift of mood taking place. maybe, just maybe, his plans for the economy might turn out to be rather successful.



  

tom hanks talks trump and brexit: 'i didn't vote for that guy'

there are three big policy shifts: a big fiscal boost from tax cuts and higher public spending, rolling back of regulations on energy and financial services, and trade controls.

the first could be huge. he has proposed cuts in personal taxes, with the headline top rate of income tax falling to 30 per cent. but maybe more important are the changes to corporation tax, with a cut to 15 per cent, and an amnesty on companiesâ foreign balances that would allow, or perhaps require, them to be repatriated with a low tax charge â say 10 per cent.

these changes, with the support of the republican majority in both houses of congress, could come in very fast. think of the effect. there would be a massive one-off flood of money into the us and out of the tax havens. the amnesty would be good news for the us taxpayer and dreadful news not only for the offshore financial centres but also for the accountants and lawyers who have devised these schemes. suddenly donald trump and the european commission would be singing the same tune, united in their efforts to make companies pay more tax.

the cut in corporation tax, coupled presumably with the closing of other loopholes, would further reduce the incentive to shuffle money offshore. countries that compete by having low corporation tax rates, in particular ireland with its 12.5 per cent rate, would suddenly find that advantage swept away. the playing field would be levelled towards the us. indeed, trumponomics would be setting a new global standard for corporate taxation.

there would, however, be some cost to the exchequer. as we learnt from reaganomics in the 1980s, if you cut taxes you may get faster growth but you do get less revenue. add in the additional spending that has been promised for infrastructure and other projects, the budget deficit will widen. that is one of the reasons why bond yields have risen. if uncle sam is going to borrow more money, he will pay a higher interest rate to do so. that, in turn, has been one of the forces pushing up the dollar. if dollar interest rates rise (and the markets are now convinced that the federal reserve will increase short-term rates again next month) the case for holding dollars rather than any other currency becomes even more compelling.

so that is why the dollar has gone up. what about shares? faster growth would certainly help, but the bull case is further increased by the promise of relaxing regulation. high-tech shares have fallen but shares in basic commodities and banks have more than offset this decline. you can make a moral judgement about this, and many people are appalled by the prospect of looser curbs on pollution and looser controls on banks. but it is easy to see why large chunks of the business community are rather encouraged. i suppose the defence would be that regulation could become lighter but remain effective, if it were to become better engineered. weâll see.

trump's transition is running smoother than obama's â will it last?



and the big negative, trade controls? i think here that us business, maybe wrongly, hopes thatâ in practiceâ the new president will be more cautious than he was in his campaigning. the harsh truth is that controls on trade with china and mexico would make americans poorer, not richer. and maybe, fingers crossed, it would be possible to create voluntary restrictions on chinese and mexican exports to the us, rather in the way that japan restricted its exports in the 1980s in response to us warnings.

the big message here is that for the moment, at least, the world of finance is happy to see the us loosen fiscal policy. now letâs see how it reacts to the loosening of uk financial policy in theâ autumn statement, which will be announced on wednesday.

        three days into the trump election victory it is becoming clear that this is not just a seismic political shock. it is also an economic shock of equal magnitude. it signals the end of ultra-loose monetary policy but offset by looser fiscal policy. the ruling orthodoxy that has swept right across the developed world since 2009, that governments should cut their budget deficits and instead rely on cheap money to boost the economy, is in its turn being swept away.

that will happen in america and it will happen in the uk. that will put pressure on europe. but quite what the various eu governments and european central bank will do in response is quite unknowable.

you can see the scale of this shift gradually dawning on the financial markets this week. to take one particular measure of the expected rise in interest rates, the yield on ten-year us treasury securities rose from just over 1.8 per cent on monday to nearly 2.2 per cent on friday. other bonds moved in much the same way. the price of bonds, which moves inversely to the yield, fell across the world, with bloomberg calculating that $1,000bn of value was lost.

of course it is true that interest rates, both short-term and long-term, remain extremely low by all historical standards. it is true, too, that this is just an immediate reaction and like all such reactions, it may be reversed. but it does not feel like that. the us federal reserve will almost certainly increase rates next month â we have just had another hint it would do so from its vice-chair, stanley fischer. and we here in the uk have been told by mark carney that the guidance that the next movement in uk rates would be down no longer holds. the outlook is now neutral.



  

donald trump shifts his position on obamacare during cbs 60 minutes interview

our own stronger than expected growth post-brexit, coupled with the inflationary impact of the fall in the pound, explains the shift here. but it would be consistent with the loosening of fiscal policy that we will be told about in 10 daysâ time.

that is the second half of the switch. in the uk any loosening will have to be modest, because we still have a fiscal deficit of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of gdp. it was 3.9 per cent in the last financial year and is not going to come down as fast as hoped this year. in the us however, the scope for easing policy is rather greater. it too has a deficit, 3.2 per cent of gdp last year, but has much greater freedom to borrow from abroad, witness the strong dollar through this year.

how much of a switch will the us make? well, all we have to go on are campaign statements by donald trump and congressional plans by republican senators and representatives. there will be personal tax cuts, for that is something on which the new president and a republican-dominated congress will find easy to agree. the top rate of income tax comes down to 33 per cent. but quite how they will reach agreement on other changes, particularly in corporation tax, is less clear.

the us has a very high nominal rate of corporation tax, 35 per cent, but companies that earn money aboard can keep the funds offshore, only paying tax if they repatriate them. unsurprisingly that is what large companies do, hence the âdouble irishâ, the balances stashed away on caribbean islands, and all the other devices us companies have, quite legally, used to reduce their tax bill.

there is an obvious deal. it would be to cut the headline rate of company tax, maybe to the 15 per cent level proposed by donald trump, have fewer loopholes, and offer an amnesty of an even lower rate on foreign balances if companies bring back the money. everyone, except the tax havens, would benefit. but it needs agreement.

whatever happens, though, it seems pretty clear that there will be a widening budget deficit. the tax cuts may bring faster growth. that is the idea at least. but growth is unlikely to be fast enough to make up the shortfall from lower rates. add to this the promised extra spending on infrastructure and the deficit would widen further. how much by, we have no idea. remember that we donât yet have a treasury secretary, or indeed any other cabinet appointments. but we can be very sure the us will choose to have a more expansionary fiscal policy.

that will put pressure on the rest of the world. the uk is in a bind because it starts from a weaker position but several european governments could, if they wished, have wider deficits. germany at the moment has a small surplus, for it is obliged to balance its budget by law. so no change there. but france (deficit last year of 3.3 per cent of gdp) and italy (2.6 per cent) would dearly love to ease the squeeze. there is an irony that the country most able to boost demand wonât do so, while those that would like to do so canât.

however when a big idea starts to move in the us, other countries do pad along behind. the big idea is the governments can do more to boost growth by fiscal policy, particularly by cutting taxes, and that this is better than trying to do so by ultra-low interest rates. expect europe eventually to follow america.â

        banksâ reopened to long lines and angry customers throughout india on thursday after the governmentâs surprise move to devalue high-denomination currency in an effort to fight corruption and so-called âblack moneyâ.

on tuesday the government announced what it called a âstrikeâ against those who keep unaccounted-for cash in india, where many jobs remain in the informal sector and few pay taxes. the countryâs reserve bank temporarily shuttered banks and atms and voided its large bank notes, issuing a 2,000-rupee note (about $30) as the largest bill today.

panicked customers lined up at banks to exchange and deposit old notes ââ sometimes standing in line for hours. fistfights broken out at petrol pumps when clerks ran out of change; at toll booths operators simply gave up charging and let cars stream through.

gold and silver prices soared as investors sought to move their money into tangible assets ââ partly a response to the currency switch as well as a reaction to global uncertainty following the usâ presidential election.

indeed, some of those lined up at banks praised the government's move, exhibiting the same populist, anti-elite fervor that drove voters to donald trump and brexit.

âi'm happy about it. the country's rot is at its roots. now the roots are going to be treated,â said kalindi jagdish, 63, an interior designer who designs homes for mumbai's wealthy and is often paid in cash.

india's finance minister, arun jaitley, called for calm at a news conference today, reminding consumers they had until 30 december to change their legitimate bills into new currency. the move brings âethics and transparencyâ and is a decisive move toward a âcashlessâ society, he said.

experts predicted the worst-hit would be wealthy professionals in real estate, doctors and lawyers who are often paid in cash to avoid taxes and stash their money in overseas accounts. only those with large sums of money âwill have to face the consequences under existing laws,â mr jaitley said.

prime minister narendra modi has long made fighting black money a priority ââ as the country moves to legitimize its shadow economy, change an age-old culture of corruption and bribes and attract foreign investment. a voluntary disclosure program has netted $19 billion so far, a fraction of estimates of the total, which range from $400bnâ to over $1 trillion.

dinesh rana was driving around delhi on thursday with a sack full of his boss's money, depositing 49,000 rupees (about $735) in separate accounts at five different banks. anything over 50,000 rupees would have garnered official scrutiny.

ârich people are worried,â he said. âthey are trying to get rid of cash or spread it around.â

some economists questioned whether the government's move would be effective in the long run.

neeraj hatekar, the director of the economics department at the university of mumbai, said that the demonetization program will be an effective tool in ridding the system of counterfeit bills - some $20m alone was seized last year in his state, he said.

but it would likely not have much impact on india's black market economy overall ââ as much illegitimate funds are in real estate or gold.

âwill it shut off new black money that's being created? it won't,â said rama bijapurkar, a market strategist and consumer expert in mumbai. âbut as a one-time shut-off it's a masterstroke.â

the impact on regular folk was immediate and widespread. rural villages whose economies are almost entirely cash-based ground to a halt as villagers scrounged for coins to pay for eggs and their daily vegetables.

wives who secretly squirreled away hundreds in kitchen kitties - away from the control of domineering husbands ââ suddenly had to admit their secret stash or ponder opening their own bank account. modi's government has made a major push to provide bank accounts to those who previously did not have them, but still 233 million remain âunbanked,â bijapurkar said.

dashrat kumar pal, 40, a steel company clerk and a delhi resident, said that the lavish wedding party for his niece had been postponed in lieu of a small religious ceremony because the family did not have enough cash to pay the vendors.

âthe big party we had planned is called off,â he said glumly. âthe cooks, the music band, the florist ââ all of them want to be paid in cash. where do we go? what do we do?â

he went on, ânow we are calling everybody and canceling.â

the governmentâs move was a boon to india's growing online payment industry, which has long operated on a cash-on-delivery model designed to address low credit card use.

after the government's announcement, downloads of digital payment apps have soared.

paytm, an online payment system, saw a 200 per cent increase in application downloads and 1,000 per cent growth in the amount of money flowing to digital wallets since tuesday evening, according to madhur deora, the chief financial officer.

âthe government's decision will structurally change the digital payment behavior of indians,â said rajnish wahi, senior vice president for corporate affairs at snapdeal, one of the major online retailers.

suchi goenka, a restaurateur in mumbai, said that while she supported the government's plan, it will take time for the country to make the change.

âin india we prefer cash,â she said. âwe were brought up that way.â

        the impact ofâ donald trump's remarkableâ victory onâ post-brexitâ britain is difficultâ to assess. trump is, broadly speaking, a fan of britain. after all, he chose scotland as the location for his ambitious plan to create the finest golf course in the world, bar none.â 

when the brexit result came through he hailed it as âa great victoryâ. nigel farage has the rare distinction of being a british politician invited to address a major rally for a mainstream presidential candidate (by mainstream i mean major party, of course). trumpâs advisors have let it be known that britain would not be last in line for a trade deal with the united states.

so, as the donald might ask, whatâs not to like?



  

trump victory speech calls on americans to become 'one united people'

wellâ¦ trumpâs general attitude to free trade deals is hostile, and the irony may be that he hailed brexit as a repudiation of free trade and freer movement of workers. the north american free trade agreement, almost a quarter century old, which linked the american, mexican and canadian economies, is regarded by trump as âthe worst deal everâ. it is not immediately obvious that a uk-us deal, say one modelled closely on the current ttip proposal, would actually be favoured by a trump administration, if there was any adverse impact on american jobs.â 

yet for a free trade agreement to work its economic magic, resources in each nation â people and capital â have to be allowed to move to more efficient uses. if not, then the free trade agreement will fail to deliver for any party.

suffice to say that the official trump approach is an âamerica firstâ trade policy and on free movement of people heâd rather build a wall to stop the mexicans coming in. it seems unlikely heâ wants to see a swathe of modern day mayflowers arriving packed with british economic migrants.

then thereâs a wider point about what president trump will do to the american economy as a whole â still the largest in the world, and which represents more than a quarter of all the economic activity on the planet.â 

we export north of â£30bn worth of goods and services to the us, a little ahead of what we sell to germany and about four times what the uk sends to china. it is a market that matters, however we get access to it.

donald trump does want to boost the economy, mainly through aggressive tax cuts. that may or may not work, and the economic evidence is contradictory, as some of trumpâs remarks sometimes are. on the whole, such is the scale of us national debt and underlying issues of competitiveness, it seems unlikely that president trump will expand this vital market so massively in the short run.â 

it is something of an imitation of the âreaganomicsâ of the 1980s (i.e. tax cuts and deregulation) which, arguably, landed the us with twin giant deficits in trade and the public finances. if it did work, americans might have more cash in the pockets to spend on british range rovers, whisky and holidays âin englandâ, as they say.â 



  

trump compares the us election to brexit

finally, thereâs trumpâs attitude to the us federal reserve and its chair, janet yellen â again, hostile. how this now pans out is anybodyâs guess, but a threat to the stability of the dollar could easily destabilise the entire world economy, and especially the financial system.â 

if global investors â especially the chinese who have stashed away trillions of dollarsâ worth of us government bonds â want to dump these because they think that president trump is about to debauch the worldâs reserve currency, the consequences would be grim indeed.

        the comparisons between the brexit vote and the victory for donald trump in the us presidential election have been flowing all morning.

thatâs true in terms of the gargantuan shock of the result, which has confounded pollstersâ confident predictions and dramatically overturned financial marketsâ expectations.

but the longer-term economic implications of both events could also be comparably significant.

below we look at the areas of economic life that are likely to be affected and contemplate who â america or britain â is likely to have it worse in the years ahead.

trade



one of the pillars of donald trumpâs campaign has been hostility and anger over free trade deals signed by america in recent decades, especially the north american free trade agreement (nafta) which he claims has been responsible for hollowing out american industry.â 

he has also been belligerent towards china, claiming that the worldâs second biggest country is undervaluing its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage with america, again harming american workers.â 

but if trump delivers on his protectionist pledges to tear up trade deals and even block imports virtually all economists believe this would make the overall american public significantly poorer, not better off.â

the leave campaign in the brexit referendum sang a different tune.

its leading lights claimed to be pro-free trade, even promising more of it if britain left the eu. and theresa mayâs government is plainly keen on maintaining the ukâs existing trade arrangements.

yet there is a serious risk that if the uk cannot agree a comprehensive free trade deal with the eu within two years of invoking article 50 with the eu, under world trade organisation rules we will have to fall back on trading with the rest of the continent.

that would mean tariffs on our exports to europe and tariffs on imports too.

and economists warn that will make us worse off by pushing up prices.

inflation



protectionist policies from trump would raise prices in the us

the dollar has fallen in the wake of the vote, which could stoke inflationary pressure in america.

but the dollar is also the ultimate safe haven currency, which should prevent a short-term collapse.

the greater danger is if trump interferes with the independence of the federal reserve, americaâs central bank, which is not impossible given his criticism of the institution during the campaign.â 

in september trump said the fed's chair, janet yellen, should be âashamedââ of her policies.

if the fed's independence goes under trump and financial markets lose confidence in the us monetary system a damaging inflationary spiral is not impossible.

in the uk, brexiteers have also criticised the governor of the bank of england mark carney and tried to push him out of his job.

but carney has confirmed he will stay until 2019.

the bigger inflationary danger for britain comes from the fall in sterling, which is down about 18 per cent since the 23 june vote.

this is expected to send domestic inflation up sharply very soon, which will make britons worse off.

immigration



trump, of course, wants to build a wall to keep out illegal mexican immigrants to the us. he has called for a âshutdownâ on muslims entering america.â 

therefore, it seems safe to assume that under a president trump immigration to the us would become significantly restricted.

that is likely to reduce the us per capita economic growth rate, by reducing the ability of the us to fill gaps in its work force and also by curtailing entrepreneurship and productivity growth.

the similarities to brexit are clear. the leave vote was won on the back of a strong anti-immigration sentiment. and theresa may has made curtailing net immigration from the eu her primary goal in the eu divorce proceedings.

as in the us, economists expect this to make the uk poorer overall since immigrants are seen as bringing a net benefit to the british economy and enhancing our prosperity.

tax

trump said he would cut income taxes, which means less money for public services (getty)

trumpâs economic policies were threadbare and incoherent. but he did say that he would cut income taxes.â 

yet the detail of those plans suggest the major beneficiaries will be the well-off, rather than ordinary middle-income americans.â 

and the implication of cutting taxes is that there will be less money to fund public services such as healthcare. america will have to either cut services, or their quality will deteriorate, or the us will have to keep piling up ever-larger government budget deficits.

the brexiteers made no promises to cut income taxes. and theresa may has not made it her priority.

but to the extent that the pain of brexit leads to a smaller economy it will make it harder for the uk to finance its public services and finance transfer payments such as pensions.

healthcare



trump has promised to reverse president obamaâs healthcare reforms, which brought millions of poor americans into the insurance safety net.â 

if he delivers on that promise those americans will be immediately worse off.â 

but all americans are likely to suffer too since those reforms, over the medium term, were a powerful means for the us to rein in massive private healthcare inflation rates.

the brexiteers notoriously promised â£350m a week in extra spending for the nhs during the referendum campaign, which they said would be paid for by cancelling the ukâs payments into the eu budget.

but that was a spurious figure because it took no account of the ukâs eu budget rebate â and, in any case, brexiteers have since dropped the claim.

the nhs is facing serious financial pressures in the years ahead due to growing demand from an ageing population. if the economy suffers due to brexit the ability of theresa mayâs government to devote additional resources to the nhs will be diminished.

        the arrival of ride-sharing app uber can reveal much about a countryâs pressure points and preoccupations. since launching in pakistan earlier this year, the high costs of car ownership and low cost of wages have thrown up unexpected problems for the company, offering captivating insights into the prevailing political economy and the role of capital owners in a sharing economy. it is not solo drivers, but those with wealth to hand who have seen uber as an investment opportunity, and in doing so they have created a distorted incentive system which damages service quality.

when uber entered the market in march 2016, pakistanâs two biggest cities seemed ideallyâ positioned for good business. lahore and karachi share a tattered public transport network (slightly less so in lahore thanks to the metro), weak rule of law, and high costs of vehicle ownership. these all imply strong demand for a safe, reliableâ and affordable cab service.

there was the promise of empowerment for many women â predominantly those working long hours outside the home â who tended to avoid public transport over security concerns. conscious of their needs, uber organised seminars on sexual harassment for drivers, instructing them to neverâ contact women passengers after the ride or to comment on their attire and lifestyle.

uber's happy go lucky drivers never existed



the efforts havenât stopped reports of sexual harassment, among other examples of service quality issues. some of those issues are driven by a trend for drivers to take maximum â and unhelpful â advantage of the inducements offered by uber as it attempts to gain a foothold.

blind spot

in order to offer drivers some protection against a lack of rides, uber would pay 270 pakistani rupees (â£2.10) an hourâ as compensation. car rental companies and dealerships were quick to respond. they identified blind spots on uberâs map and placed all their available cars there so they could earn money while parked up. others, enticed by good demand, rented cars and hired drivers to pick up passengers. fleet ownership is endorsed by uber but fleet driver compensation appears to be left to the discretion of the carâs owner.

this represented a shift from the standard model of the service that customers are used to in the west, where the owner of the car and the driver are the same person. this is the caseâ in markets with relatively high rates of car ownership where financing is easily available from banks or from uber itself. in other markets fleet owners tend to charge drivers a monthly rental but let them retain, at least most of, their earnings. in pakistan, a large number of the drivers were employees of the owner, and not owners themselves, working for fixed salaries rather than a percentage of earnings. this appeared to be the cause of a distorted incentive system.

because the drivers were on a fixed salary, they earned the same regardless of whether they provided a service or not. many drivers frequently cancelled rides and harassed customers; often making them cancel rides. this same trend has been the case in india as well. at least in the immediate term, their own monthly compensation would remain unaffected.

capital drive

whether these issues are ultimately found to be teething problems or structural constraints, they underlie the rentier-sharing economy nexus which favours the rentiers who live off accumulated wealth, savings or inheritances. the sharing economy allows those who own cars and homes to generate an income by using technology to offer them to strangers. the nexus works because when rentiers share they accumulate. then they share more.

a key issue here is access to finance. another is the often hazy distinction between the rentier and the real economy, since they often create jobs too. the third is the matter of concentrated ownership in the sharing economy.

the mainstay of the rentier is unequal access to finance. the economist john maynard keynes referred to this when he noted that the âeuthanasia of the rentierâ would occur when capital was abundant. the scarcity of capital in pakistan, where lending rates and documentation requirements constrain car ownership, comes across as a key reason behind the distorted incentives underlying uberâs poor service quality.

the heart of the matter (flickr)

it is likely that such issues have compelled the service to drastically reduce faresâ to attract more customers. and so, instead of being an opportunity for car owners to earn an income on a self-employed basis or as an âentreployeeâ, uber became an investment opportunity for those looking to deploy accumulated wealth.

the corollary here is that uber did create jobs. isnât that the most important outcome? here, there are two points worth considering. one is that accumulation patterns would have been different had financial access been more inclusive. and two is the tendency of rentier capitalism to create the social class that soas economist guy standing describes as âthe precariatâ.

this is the group whose earning patterns are characterised by unstable contracts such as zero-hours contracts, and by the absence of non-wage benefits. uber drivers in the richest countries also generally fall into this category but, as owners rather than employees, they are relatively better off than those in countries such asâ pakistan and india. the comparison is an example of the mechanisms that drive higher inequality in poor countries.

the third trend is growing concentration of ownership in the sharing economy. airbnb data for new york indicates the much of the companyâs revenue comes from people with multiple listings. this weakens the notion that there is a culture of âsharingâ rather than one of rentierism which drives such business. at the core of this is the price of property, which limits ownership. uber seems to be following the same trend in pakistan where diminutive purchasing power makes car ownership an elusive dream for most.

        what donald trump would do for, or to, the uk post-brexit is quite tricky one to assess. if we were to wake up to a president trump next week then we would certainly have a personality who is, broadly speaking, a fan of britain. after all, he chose scotland as the location for his ambitious plan to create the finest golf course in the world, bar none.â 

when the brexit result came through he hailed it as âa great victoryâ. nigel farage has the rare distinction of being a british politician invited to address a major rally for a mainstream presidential candidate (by mainstream i mean major party, of course). trumpâs advisors have let it be known that britain would not be last in line for a trade deal with the united states.

so, as the donald might ask, whatâs not to like?

                american economist and an external member of the monetary policy committee of the bank of england argues that the economy had been âless stormy than many expectedâ following the shock referendum result: âfor nowâ¦the economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. the adverse winds could quickly pick up â and merit a stronger policy response. but recently they have shifted to a more favourable directionâ

wellâ¦ trumpâs general attitude to free trade deals is hostile, and the irony may be that he hailed brexit as a repudiation of free trade and freer movement of workers. the north american free trade agreement, almost a quarter century old, which linked the american, mexican and canadian economies, is regarded by trump as âthe worst deal everâ. it is not immediately obvious that a uk-us deal, say one modelled closely on the current ttip proposal, would actually be favoured by a trump administration, if there was any adverse impact on american jobs.â 

yet for a free trade agreement to work its economic magic, resources in each nation â people and capital â have to be allowed to move to more efficient uses. if not, then the free trade agreement will fail to deliver for any party.

suffice to say that the official trump approach is an âamerica firstâ trade policy and on free movement of people heâd rather build a wall to stop the mexicans coming in. it seems unlikely heâd want to see a swathe of modern day mayflowers arriving packed with british economic migrants.

then thereâs a wider point about what president trump would do to the american economy as a whole â still the largest in the world, and which represents more than a quarter of all the economic activity on the planet.â 

we export north of â£30bn worth of goods and services to the us, a little ahead of what we sell to germany and about four times what the uk sends to china. it is a market that matters, however we get access to it.

donald trump does want to boost the economy, mainly through aggressive tax cuts. that may or may not work, and the economic evidence is contradictory, as some of trumpâs remarks sometimes are. on the whole, such is the scale of us national debt and underlying issues of competitiveness, it seems unlikely that president trump would expand this vital market so massively in the short run.â 



  

nigel farage says donald trump must focus on the issues

it is something of an imitation of the âreaganomicsâ of the 1980s (i.e. tax cuts and deregulation) which, arguably, landed the us with twin giant deficits in trade and the public finances. if it did work, americans might have more cash in the pockets to spend on british range rovers, whisky and holidays âin englandâ, as they say.â 

finally, thereâs trumpâs attitude to the us federal reserve and its chair, janet yellen â again, hostile. how this might pan out is anybodyâs guess, but a threat to the stability of the dollar could easily destabilise the entire world economy, and especially the financial system.â 

if global investors â especially the chinese who have stashed away trillions of dollarsâ worth of us government bonds â want to dump these because they think that president trump is about to debauch the worldâs reserve currency, the consequences would be grim indeed.

        innovation entails a series of discontinuous, highly significant technological jumps, followed by gradual adoption and modest incremental improvements.

economist robert gordon argues that the second industrial revolution, entailing developments in electricity, internal combustion engines, modern communications, entertainment, petroleum/ hydro-carbons and chemicals, had the most impact on productivity and living standards. the third industrial revolution, based around computing and the internet, appears to be less important. its reduced impact is the result of its focus, and structure.

first, unlike key inventions of the second industrial revolution, the emphasis has been on improving existing processes to expand its usage or increase efficiency. computers have helped automate repetitive, routine and low-value administrative and clerical work. increasingly sophisticated software, such as computer-aided manufacturing (cam) and design (cad), improved industrial efficiency. linking users through sophisticated telecommunications, such as high-speed broadband and wireless connectivity, has extended this process, improving existing technologies, enhancing efficiency, speed, capability and power.

in many cases, the changes did not reduce the workload but used digital technology toâ disperse it across the workforce. for example, word processing software did not eliminate the need to type out documents but eliminated secretaries and typing pools leaving individuals to undertake the task themselves. it was a philosophy of doing more with less.

the new technologies also do not entail a radical reshaping of modes of doing things.â a driverless car is still a car. the change is not equivalent to the shift from animal-powered transportation. the internet and email may improve the speed of communication but it is not as radical as the original advent of telephony and modern communication.

second, the focus is on consumption, improving marketing and distribution of existing goods and services. it also centres on entertainment and communication, with tangential impact on productivity.

in june 2014, amazon announced its latest innovation, a smartphone that uses image recognition technology to allow customers to purchase products by pointing it at more than 70 million objects in its online store. the âweapon of mass consumptionâ or a ""point and shoot yourself in the foot"" device was designed to minimise frictions and barriers to spending and provide instant gratification.

alphabet (formerly google) is, in reality, a giant advertising company, deriving a large proportion of its us$75bn (â£61.5bn)â in revenue from this source. much of this is from search advertising where google places ads related to what someone is looking for online, exploiting the firm domination of the global search markets (around 70 per cent market share). facebookâs business model is similar. like google, its size and large user base allows it to gain personal and behavioural information, interests and connections enabling it to target advertising effectively.

the post-2000 internet boom has focused on instant messaging, online gaming, video games and new media. a major area has been social media, which one commentator wryly dismissed as âjust places for people to express their narcissism cheaplyâ.â 

interestingly, by 2016, users were complaining of fatigue as they were increasingly inundated by a flood of addictive but useless and invasive messages from a variety of fragmented applications.

third, many new technologies displace or cannibalise existing industries, limiting the effect on growth and productivity.

for example, gramophone records were replaced successively by cassette tapes, cds, mp3, and digital media such as itunes and live streaming. some 30 years after it was displaced, analogue vinyl re-emerged as an expensive, fashionable niche product, completing the cycle. although it made minimal difference to their enjoyment, people owned the same music in several different media, together with the associated paraphernalia, creating a peculiar form of economic activity.

smartphones and tablets cannibalise desk top and lap top computers. they have cannibalised mobile phones and blackberries, portable music players such as sonyâs cd walkman or mp3 players and personal digital assistants like the once ubiquitous palm pilot. they have also replaced low-end cameras and watches. they are incorporating gps and other standalone devices. the revenue gain for smartphones is offset by the reduction in the products it replaces.

google and blogs divert revenue from newspapers, publishing and libraries. digital advertising diverts revenue from traditional newspaper, magazine and tv advertising. email supplanted the existing system of communication via mail. online entertainment and gaming replaces pre-existing modes of delivery of these products.

fourth, the third industrial revolution emphasises disruptive technologies, a term associated with harvard professor clayton christensen and his influential 1997 book the innovator's dilemma. it differentiated between sustainable innovations, which improve products and make valuable changes for a firm's current customers, and disruptive innovations, cheaper, poorer-quality products that initially reaches less profitable customers but uses the threat of new potential products and new customers to seek to dominate the industry.

many recent âdisruptiveâ innovations rely on decreased cost, using lower quality products or using untrained individuals or personal assets. airbnb allows people to rent out their own lodging for accommodation. uber, a ride-sharing application, allows individuals to use their own cars to provide transportation. alternatively, it entails arbitraging regulations to lower costs. many online media or entertainment services rely on unpaid labour that contributes their services for free.

the most notable effect is the alteration of industry economics. new technologies changed advertising rates in the us. the us$51 per thousand views in a newspaper became us$29 for tv, $15 magazines, $4.70 for desktops, $4.42 for tablets and $1.31 for mobile devices. in the words of one commentator:â  ânewspaper dollars have turned to digital dimes â ten cent pieces â and those in turn are turning into mobile penniesâ. in effect, innovation turned âanalogue dollarsâ into âdigital penniesâ.

while advertisers benefitted, the loss of earnings of traditional media businesses resulted in less employment, less investment, and lower research and development expenditure. arguably, it increased the diversity of information available. but the absence of fact checking and editorial oversight contributed to a loss of accuracy and quality.

fifth, the key innovations of the third industrial revolution are, by their nature, easily scalable. electronic platforms and the pervasiveness of the internet mean that expansion of activity does not necessarily require a commensurate expansion in investment and operational capacity.

many innovations also piggy-back off existing infrastructure. e-tailing and online stores rely on existing distribution and delivery infrastructure. the creation of automobiles required the parallel development of material suppliers, like steel, aluminium, lead and rubber, fuel supplies, servicing and repairs as well as the entire road and highway system. in contrast, new technologies rarely create this scale of ancillary and supporting industries.

these factors contribute to higher efficiency but reduce the overall economic impact.

sixth, the hardware and software technologies that underpin some innovations are dynamic. this reduces their life cycle. it also leads to waste in terms of investment and also affects the speed of adoption.

seventh, the new technologies have complex side effects. computing and connectivity have destructive unintended uses, like spam, propagation of viruses and facilitating cyber crime, including identity theft. it creates a redundant cycle of destructive innovation and counter measures, such as anti-virus and anti-malware software, which does not generate true economic value.

while it may simply be too early for the full impact to become evident, the third industrial revolution does not appear to have driven the epochal change of electricity or the internal combustion engine.

        this will be a week dominated by economics â on both sides of the atlantic. the reason is that both the uk and the us will have a set of third-quarter gdp figures, the first since the referendum vote in the uk, and the last before the presidential vote in the us. insofar as people allow their wallets and purses to shape their political ideas, expect a politicised response to each, for even if voters rise about the economic numbers (or maybe simply donât believe them) politicians think they do.

âitâs the economy, stupid,â was the phrase coined by james carville, campaign strategist for bill clinton in 1992. it may or may not have worked, but politicians the world over think it did, and bill clinton did win.

here in the uk this issue is whether brexit is hitting the economy. on thursday the office for national statistics gives the first official verdict as to whether the economy has slowed since the vote. it will have done so. in the second quarter growth was 0.7 per cent, an annual rate of a bit under 3 per cent. in the third quarter it is expected to be 0.3 per cent or 0.4 per cent â anything slower or faster would be a big story â so an annual rate of well under 2 per cent.

this news will be greeted either as evidence that the economy is so far weathering the brexit blow well, or, depending on your approach to such matters, that the expected slow-down has already begun. actually, since initial gdp figures are invariably revised, often for several years, you should take these ones with a pinch of salt. actually i will be more interested in the index of services, also published by the ons on thursday, which give a more timely indication of what is happening to the service sector of the economy, which makes up no less than 79 per cent of the total. these will be reasonably strong, but face a squeeze in the months ahead.

the us gdp figures should show a bit of a pick-up since the summer, when growth was running at an annual rate of only 1.4 per cent (americans express the quarterly numbers at an annual rate, whereas we quote them at the quarterly rate). but even if we assume they pick up to, say, 2.25 per cent, this will merely convince people who argue that this is the weakest recovery since the second world war, and that this is in some measure the fault of government. itâs the ârecovery for wall street, not main streetâ charge, and it is difficult to rebut itâ because until recently it has indeed been a recovery in asset prices rather than wages. thisâ year living standards have at last started to move strongly forward. thatâs an achievement, says president obama; about time too say his critics.

thereâs a further issue here. people may technically be richer but many donât feel it, and there are a couple of us consumer surveys out this week that may show that confidence is still weak. on tuesday the conference board publishes some numbers and these are expected to fall back from september, and on friday there are the university of michiganâs consumer sentiment figures.

i donât think any of this information will have a material impact on the election. nor are the data likely to change the picture for the federal reserve, now expected to increase interest rates again in december â an interesting contrast, by the way, to the picture in the uk and europe. but they will tell us something about the economy that the next president will inherit: growing slowly but unevenly both in terms of geography and income levels, and sharply divided as to what should be done about it.

of the rest, well, there will be a lot of european data, including inflation in germany, france and spain, and gdp in france and spain too. but the area that excites me more will be anything to do with apple, because they will tell us more about high-tech america. the company has benefited from the travails of samsung, but that will be a short-term boost and profits are expected to fall for the first time for several years. that would not be a disaster, but more widespread weakness in high-tech industries would.â

        unless there is something quite shattering in tonightâs tv debate between hillary clinton and donald trump, clinton is overwhelmingly likely to become the next us president. ahead of the debate the odds put that at an 80 per cent chance, while the possibility of any other outcome is simply not factored into the financial markets at all. the only market that jumps around whenever the possibility of a trump victory nudges up a little is the rate for the mexican peso; a trump presidency is not seen as bullish for the peso.

but this apparent calm is itself a worry. if people are not prepared for a political surprise, they are liable to react violently should it occur. we have seen something of that in the uk over the past four months. so what can sensibly be said â from an economic perspective â about the us under the next president? ten thoughts.

one, this is an economy that has grown solidly since the great recession, and which is starting to get pretty close to pull capacity. in cyclical terms, some sort of slowdown should be on the horizon, though the severity of the last downturn suggests that recession is less likely than in previous cycles.

two, despite nearing full capacity, the us is still running a fiscal deficit of 3.2 per cent of gdp. there is no obvious scope for a looser policy.â 

three, the plans of the two candidates are utterly different: huge cuts in taxation from donald trump; modest rises in taxation at the top end under hillary clinton. but you have to take all such plans with a pinch of salt. for, as in that adage âthe president proposes but congress disposesâ, fiscal policy will be largely determined by the legislators, not the administration.

so, point four, it is safe to assume that the us deficit will remain high, maybe growing a bit, through the next four years. financial markets will have to feel comfortable with that, probably bidding up long-term interest rates as a result.

and if that is right, the present era of ultra-easy money will draw to a close. if long rates go up, the federal reserve will put up short rates. already the market expects this, and the debate is about when and by how much it increases rates, not about whether.

this will affect the rest of the world. in the short-term the dollar is likely to get stronger. if you have spare cash better to have it earning some interest in dollars, rather than none in euros or yen. in the long-term, rates around the rest of the world will be pulled up too.

seven, there is a danger, much greater under trump than under clinton, that us support for free trade will weaken.â globalisation is seen as working against the interests of ordinary us workers. disruption of us trade with china is quite possible â maybe not a trade war, but a cooler relationship eventually leading to slower growth worldwide.

whoever wins will have to lead a deeply divided nation, not just socially, politically and geographically â we all know that â but also structurally. this is not just a wall street/main street thing. what is happening in the high-tech industries of the west coast is utterly different from just about everywhere else. these structural fissures will in all probability widen over the next four years.

other countries, notably china and russia, will want to test the new president. for whoever wins, that will be seen as an opportunity to advance their interests against those of the us. we could see a very bumpy 2017.

and, finally, those bumps are likely to be much greater under a trump presidency than under a clinton one. since the former outcome is not factored into most peopleâs thinking it would be particularly disruptive. but even a clinton victory would not be a recipe for calm. the tensions within the us economy will see to that.

the prediction follows the very eerie episode ""bart of the future"";â which imagines a dystopian, nightmare future in which (ahem) donald trump is president of the united states, which its writer has stated was intended as a ""warning to america"".â an episode last month also made reference to beloved golfer arnold palmer, only a few hours after his death had been announced.

        how should a company set the pay of its chief executive?â 

bengt holmstrom, an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology, has won the nobel prize for economics along with oliver hart, who can be found at nearby harvard, in part for his work on that very subject.â 

mr holmstrom, who is a former director of nokia among other things, in the 1970s demonstrated how a principle, for example, a companyâs shareholders, should design an optimal contract for an agent, say, their chief executive.â

nobel prize for economics awarded to oliver hart and bengt holmstrã¶m



his âinformativeness principleâ is a model for how the ceoâs contract should link their pay to information relevant to their performance, after due regard has been paid to weighing risks against incentives. the work has been developed, debated and refined since that time.

the award of the nobel prize is particularly apposite today given the fierce debate being conducted about executive remuneration packages in the light of yet more scandal.â 

in the us, where the two men work, that debate is currently centred upon on the eye popping awards handed to executives at well fargo, a retail bank in the midst of a scandal over the creation of bogus accounts.â 

john stumpf, its chief executive officer, is to forfeit $41m (â£33m) in unvested share awards, will not receive a salary while the bank investigates the scandal, and wonât receive a bonus for 2016.

carrie tolstedt, who headed the community banking unit that employed numerous workers who illegally opened unwanted accounts, has lost unvested share equity awards worth about $19 million. she also wonât receive any severance pay, or any bonus for 2016 and wonât â be able to sell any stock during the probe.â 

it sounds painful, but theyâve both made considerable fortunes through working at the bank and as the writs fly, and the bankâs shares slide, the shareholders who hired them have lost considerable fortunes.â

needless to say, the creation of new accounts was heavily incentivised, while staff were pressurised to meet unattainable targets. clearly the risk - that people in this environment would end up gaming the system - wasnât effectively weighed when the incentives and the targets were set.â 

more fool shareholders for approving the awards in the first place, you might think. perhaps they ought to read up on mr holmstromâs work.â 

but the problem goes beyond the methods used to set pay and design packages.â

theresa may's executive pay plans backed by fidelity



the ceo pay pot had already been stirred by corporate governance research firm msci, which examined the packages of some 800 ceos at 429 large and midsize us companies during the 10 years to the end of 2014. it also looked at the total shareholder return of those companies - a measure of the share price performance and of the dividends paid.â 

the firm found that had you invested $100 in the one fifth of those companies with the highest paid ceos youâd have made $265. however, if you had put your money with the companies that paid the least youâd have made $367.

this challenges the prevailing assumption that shareholders do better when they make a hireling an owner alongside them and incentivise them by handing them chunky share awards tied to company performance.â 

what all the toing and froing, including mr holmstromâs prize winning model, misses is a rather important point: there are social consequences to executive rewards as well as corporate and investment consequences.â 

companies do not exist in vacuums. at a time of rising inequality, and insecurity, the pay packages handed to their ceos are contributing to the anger and unrest that are the consequences.â 

it isnât exaggerating to say that they played a role in both the disastrous brexit vote and the rise of donald trump, a plutocrat promising to tear up the system up in favour of the ordinary working joe. scarcely credible, i know, but people are buying it even after the ugly revelations about his sexual behaviour that emerged over the weekend. â 

both phenomena have their roots in populist outrage at an economic system that appears rigged.

as such, it isnât only model for setting ceo pay, and how it is linked to performance, that is at fault. the problem is not with agents, and principles, and the finer points of contract theory that the prize winners cast light upon.â 

it is as much with the quantum of awards that have surged at a rate that far outstrips the growth in average earnings, where there has been any growth at all, and the effect that has had against the backdrop of an increasingly insecure and unequal society.â

                      former reckitt benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in south korea jailed for seven years - friday january 6                   
        
                a former south korean executive of uk-based reckitt benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.

shin hyun-woo, head of reckitt benkiserâs oxy subsidiary from 1991 to 2005, was found guilty of accidental homicide and falsely advertising the deadly product as being safe even for children. 
the consumer product disaster affected many families in south korea, where children and pregnant women often battle dry winter seasons with humidifiers. 
other retailers such as lotte mart and homeplus were also found guilty of selling the deadly product.

the court  ruled on that kerviel was âpartly responsibleâ for massive losses suffered in 2008 by his former employer societe generale through his reckless trades. 

kerviel has consistently maintained that bosses at the french bank knew what he was doing all along.

the court rejected ms lagarde's appeal against a judge's order in december for her to stand trial over allegations of negligence in her handling of the affair.
ms lagarde could risk a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of â¬15,000 euros if convicted.

                two ex- pricewaterhousecoopers staffers were found guilty in luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.

antoine deltour and raphael halet face suspended sentences of 12 months and 9 months and were ordered to pay fines of â¬1,500 (â£1,230) and  â¬1,000 (â£822) for their role in the so-called luxleaks scandal. despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by deltourâs lawyer as âshockingâ and âa terrible anomaly.â

the ruling âputs on guard future whistle-blowers,â deltour told reporters.the luxleaks revelations sped beyond luxembourg, causing european union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while eu lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc.

the winners of the nobel prize for economics are to be congratulated. they are clever, talented people who have done valuable work. for that they will split sk8m (â£745,000).â 

it is a tidy sum but it just serves to illustrate the point i just made. the average ftse 100 chief executive will make that sum in less than three months. their us equivalents will make it after an even shorter interval. for far too many that sum would represent a mere rounding error when set against their overall package including, iâm sorry to say, the bosses of wells fargo.â 

what we really need to discuss is not the methods or the models used to set executive pay, but how best to bring it down to a more acceptable level given the unrest it is contributing to.â

""through their initial contributions, hart and holmstrã¶m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions,"" the academy said.

contract theory concerns the way economic actors construct contractural arrangments, usually working with imperfect information.

""contract theory does not necessarily provide definitive or unique answers to these questions as the best contract will typically depend on th specific cicumstances and context. however, the power of the theory is that it enables us to think clearly about the issues involved,"" said the academy.

in response to the news mr hart today said: ""i woke at 4.40am and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang"".

""i feel very lucky and grateful. i certainly did not expect it, at least at this time,"" said mr holmstrã¶m.

in a 1979 paper mr holmstrã¶m suggested that in an optimal contract a chief executive's pay should be benchmarked to their firm's performance relative to peer companies because simply linking compensation to the firmâs share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish them for bad luck.

such benchmarking is now standard in the remuneration contracts of executives of listed companies and the majority of their pay often takes the form of share and cash bonuses.

however, mr holmstrã¶m in that paper also suggested that in high-risk industries where the manager's performance was harder to measure pay should be skewed to fixed salaries.

in a news conference today mr holmstrã¶m said large bonuses to executives awarded under modern contracts were ""too complicated"", although he declined to say whether or not the sums paid out were too high.

but the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

                the british pound has suffered a sudden collapse hitting a new 31-year low against the us dollar in mysterious circumstances, sparking market chaos in âinsaneâ early trading.
the drop was sterling's biggest since britain voted to leave the eu in june.

                chancellor philip hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor george osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the ukâs brexit vote.

in early july mr osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the uk is still âopen for businessâ despite the vote to leave the eu.
in his speech to the conservative party conference in birmingham today, mr hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

mr hart's work has focused on ""incomplete contracts"", where agreements are not detailed enough to cover every eventuality.

he has also explored whether services such as health, education and penal correction are better provided by the public or the private sector.

talking about his work mr hart said: ""contracts are just an incredibly powerful way of thinking about parts of economics. theyâre just fundamental to the whole idea that trade is a quid pro quo and that there are two sides to a transactionâ.

the academy said: ""thanks to the work of oliver hart and bengt holmstrã¶m, we now have the tools to analyse not only contractsâ financial terms, but also the contractual allocation of control rights, property rights, and decision rights between parties. the contributions by the laureates have helped us understand many of the contracts we observe in real life.""

the economics prize is the only nobel not created by the swedish dynamite inventor and philanthropist, alfred nobel, in the late 19th century and was only launched in 1968.

the nobel prizes for physiology, medicine, chemistry and peace were awarded last week.

this year the peace prize went to the colombian president juan manuel santos for his peace deal with the farc rebels, despite the fact that the agreement was rejected in a shock nationalâ referendum result only days earlier.

the literature nobel will be awarded on thursday.

fifty five of the 76 nobel economics awards are gone to people withâ us citizenship, although that includes dual nationalities.

last year's winner of the nobel economic prize wasâ angus deaton, like mr hart, another british-bornâ economist who now works in the us.

mr hart moved to the us in 1984.â mr holmstrã¶m has been on the faculty of mit since 1994.

        the fall of the pound is not exactly big news here in the us, though it is a painful shock for the many british over for the annual meetings of the imf and world bank. but the fact that a political event should have such a profound impact on financial markets has caused deep concern for an obvious reason. now it may be that the revelations of the past couple of days, coupled perhaps by the next tv debate between hillary clinton and donald trump on sunday night, will change things. but a trump victory would be a much greater shock to global finance than the brexit vote, yet the markets have hardly begun to factor that into their considerations.â 

there are two separate issues here. one is the extent to which economic policy may change after the us presidential election. the other is how global finance will view the outcome.

as far as policy is concerned, you have to remember that the president proposes, but congress disposes. a clinton administration would in all probability have to contend with a republican congress, which would limit its ability to increase taxes on high earners. she has proposed a set of increases, including cuts in the ability of top earners to make specific deductions from their taxable income, and an increase in estate duties, that would largely fall on the top 1 per cent of american earners. mr trump, by contrast, proposes cuts on all taxes, but with the effect skewed towards the wealthiest. the top tax rate he proposes would be 25 per cent, compared with 39.6 per cent now.â

donald trumpâs trade adviser says uk will go to front of queue



if you believe the calculations (which are as suspect as all estimates of the effect of fiscal changes), the clinton plans would have the effect of cutting gdp growth by 1 per cent in the long term, while the trump plans would increase it by up to 10 per cent â if it were appropriately financed. and thereâs the rub. the trump plan would add hugely to national debt, which might drive up long term interest rates and so reduce the potential for growth.

the point about all these calculations is that they are based on what a candidate would like to do rather than what would happen in the real world. this is particularly so in the us. policy will change after the election, but i suspect by less than people expect. what will matter more will be the mood music about future policy, and whoever wins there is capacity for surprises.

you see, both candidates have caught theâ mood of the country running against free trade. mr trump articulates it more strongly, but ms clinton has been forced into less liberal statements in recent months. in private she is pro-trade. in the past 24 hours there have been leaks of statements she made in paid speeches to the business community, calling for âopen trade and open bordersâ. but in public she is more circumspect.â

âi will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages â including the trans-pacific partnership,â she told a union audience in august. âi oppose it now, iâll oppose it after the election, and iâll oppose it as president.â

the us going protectionist? that would be a huge shift for the whole world, and a big blow to global business confidence. at the moment such a shift is not even being considered by the financial markets, but there is a very real chance it might happen.

for those of us who grew up in the immediate post-war world, the creation of the three organisations what were founded following the bretton woods agreement in 1944 â the imf, the world bank, and the general agreement on tariffs and trade, later the world trade organisation â were the base on which the great burst of post-war prosperity was founded. further regional deals, including the north american free trade agreement signed by bill clinton, took the process further. the tpp would take it further still.â 

the problem is that people hurt by trade deals, including workers who lose their jobs because of cheaper goods imported from abroad, are specific and can be identified. the beneficiaries, including consumers who buy cheaper goods, are far more numerous, but the gains are more general and harder to pin down. successive american administrations have in general been champions of greater freedom for trade, supporting the post-war consensus, though in some specific areas the us remains protectionist. now that general support seems to be fraying.

the key point here is that the forthcoming election, whoever wins, may see a shift in the position of the us on freedom of global trade and investment flows. the shift would probably be greater were mr trump to win, but there seems likely to be some movement against free trade and capital flows were ms clinton to do so. this would be a far bigger shock than brexit.

        according to the chancellor philip hammond, the uk economy is entering a ânew phaseâ. and with brexit now around the corner, it is. but to be successful outside the eu, theresa may must prove that britain it is willing to do things differently. an economy whose health is measured by more than just financial returns would be an excellent place to start.

this new phase could begin with moving beyond the view that gdp alone is a sufficient way to understand and monitor our national progress. why? because, while gdp captures the monetary value of the economy, it does not help us to grasp the complexity of the uk economy and how well we are doing at the things that really make a country work. it cannot help us understand whether our cities, our communities and our lives are improving.

the old business truism, âwhat gets measured gets managedâ, is one that todayâs politicians would do well to heed. if your economic indicators are too narrowly focused then even the most well-meaning of policies devised off the back of them will be equally restricted in their scope and purpose.

what theresa may said â and what she really meant



what does gdp tell us about how prepared an apprentice or graduate is for their first day at work? what do gross margins let us know about the integrity of the financial services industry? how do buoyant gdp levels alert us to an imbalanced economy?â 

speaking almost 50 years ago, bobby kennedy summed it up: âthe gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play â¦ it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.â

although the uk economy has grown and dynamic businesses have flourished in recent years, we know also that this prosperity is not equally shared. too many people and places have been left behind. there are deep-rooted social and economic issues in the uk that threaten our long-term prosperity, including a low level of trust in our national institutions, a lack of skills among young people and a country whose financial stability is too heavily reliant on the economic success of a handful of cities.

riding with blinkers on, economists and statisticians have long failed to resolve these issues because they have adhered to very narrow measurements of success. in short: it looks like weâre doing well, but weâre not.â 

we need a shift in perspective. we must continue to seek economic prosperity but also demand that his prosperity takes in everything that it means to run a successful society â our health, our wealth and our ability to thrive. everything that enables each of us to pursue a great life.

so we need a new system of measuring our economy that understands all this, one that takes into account the wellbeing of society alongside a healthy bottom line.

instead of speaking of, and working in, abstract growth figures, itâs time for the uk government to measure the countryâs growth in ways that reflect the modern demands of society, as well as the economy. how we, as a country, measure our progress, success and setback must evolve to something that helps people live a great life, at work and at home.â 

so, what would be on the new score card? measurements should be taken not just of levels of inclusion and equality, economic resilience, sustainability, trust, community, and the sense of belonging.â from analysing the growth of people by measuring their education levels and scoring their personal wellbeing and happiness, to examining social inclusion, housing affordability, child poverty and levels of deprivation, we need to lay out a new set of economic values. they must also include levels of cultural activity and community engagement. all such factors should be brought together in one places, so that we can better understand how well britain is working.â 

the most successful countries in the future will marry business and society together. to realise the ukâs potential and build a sustainable country that can thrive outside of the eu, we have to rethink our national measurements and come up with a new system of understanding our economy that reflects our modern society. antiquated and off-the-rack just wonât cut it anymore.â 

and if we get this right, we wonât be the eccentric outsider doing things their own way, weâll be leading the way in how to think about and understand social and economic success. what better way to start our new post-brexit relationship with the rest of the world.

        since 2008, policymakers have sought to use low rates to boost economic growth and increase inflation in order to bring elevated debt levels under control. low rates should encourage debt-financed consumption and investment, feeding a virtuous cycle of expansion. boosts to asset prices should support the collateral value against which banks have lent. higher asset prices should result in increases in wealth encouraging spending. low rates and abundant liquidity should drive inflation.

the policies have succeeded in creating a precarious stability. they have not created growth or inflation.

increasingly, constrained by the zero lower bound (zlb) of rates, policymakers have found it necessary to innovate. they have used quantitative easing (qe) to purchase securities to lower interest rates. they have also directly employed negative rates.

negative rates work through the same economic channels as low or zero rates. they have extra power in that savers suffer actual cash losses over and above any loss in purchasing power through negative real interest rates. in theory, the threat of actual loss should increase investment and consumption, helping economic growth and inflation.

below zero rates also target the velocity of money, which has declined sharply since the great recession reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy globally. it is intended to increase the speed of circulation of money, as everyone seeks to avoid the loss caused by holding cash (commonly referred to as the ""hot potato"" argument).

it is also designed to encourage banks to lend aggressively. a key objective is to reduce excess reserves held by banks at central banks. the money is the result of qe schemes which have not flowed into the real economy. negative rates impose a cost on banks, forcing them to increase loans thereby reducing their excess reserves.

the major unstated objective of negative interest rates is currency manipulation. negative rates are a methamphetamine boosted form of zero or low interest which is designed to devalue a currency, as investors move capital elsewhere to avoid loss. lower currencies increase export competitiveness by decreasing costs. it also decreases the purchasing power of debt denominated in the currency to reduce real debt levels.

in reality, negative interest rates are the result of a failure of policies to deal with unsustainable debt levels.

debt can only be reduced by strong growth, inflation, currency devaluation (where the borrowing is from foreigners) or default. all the strategies other than growth involve some level of transfer of value from savers, either by reduction in the nominal value returned or decreased purchasing power.

growth and inflation are low. devaluation is difficult if every nation pursues a similar set of policies attempting to reduce the value of their currency. debt default of the scale required would destroy a large portion of worldâs savings as well as affect the solvency of the financial system, triggering a collapse of economic activity. as a result, policymakers refuse to allow write-downs of trillions of dollars of debt that cannot be paid back.

in absence of any politically acceptable and economically manageable solution, policymakers now rely on extend and pretend strategies combined with financial repression. low rates and qe allow borrowings to be maintained to avoid a solvency crisis.

central banks are covertly using negative rates to reduce excessive debt levels by transferring wealth from savers to borrowers through the slow confiscation of capital. in the us, zero interest rates have reduced the interest cost of the us$15 trillion us banking system. the reduction in annual interest income for savers is around $450bn, from roughly $500bn to only $50bn annually. negative interest rates reduce the principal of the debt directly.

these actions retard growth, promote deflation and create fertile condition for financial crises. such policies are also difficult to reverse as high debt levels and the asset values that support them are only sustainable with very low interest rate.

it is a foolâs paradise, where a state of bliss is reliant on ignorance or denial of potential trouble.

negative rates point to the fact that the global economic system cannot generate sufficient income to service, let alone repay, current debt levels. it is an attempt to maintain artificial current asset values and the debt that it supports. artificially depressed rates only allow this excessive debt to be managed. it does not improve the real economy or enhance its productive capacity. in fact, the toxic side effects of the policies are damaging to economic activity. more fundamentally, the measures damage the trust that the economic system needs to function properly.

such financial manipulation will ultimately reach its limit, with catastrophic consequence. the form it will take and its exact timing remains unknowable. the reality is that current policies if continues make it inevitable.

        if you have low expectations you wonât be disappointed ââ not a bad way to approach life, as well as economics. but it is particularly appropriate when approaching opec meetings, for the tensions within what has always been a disparate group of countries are greater than ever.â 

meeting after meeting has resulted in stalemate. conventional wisdom says that will happen again this wednesday, when the 14 opec members have an informal meeting in algiers, following the international energy forum that starts on monday. a top-level russian delegation is at the forum, and it may join opec for the meeting.

yet there is a chance that this one might be different. there might be an agreement on a production freeze between russia and saudi arabia, and a cap on production in iran. if that happened there could be a real impact on the oil price.â 

in recent months both russia and saudi arabia have been increasing production to record levels. iran, in theory freed from sanctions, has been rebuilding its oil industry. on my quick back-of-an-envelope tally, those three account for one third of global oil production. had they not boosted output this year, the oil price would have recovered much faster.

tories have given up on austerity, but so has the rest of the world



will they agree? the rumours fly. one story is that russia will not join any talks with opec unless and until opec members agree on production levels. relations between saudi arabia and iran remain tense.â 

but it is nevertheless in the self-interest of the producers to get an agreement; you cannot rule out the possibility that some sort of understanding could be reached. and then, just as hardly anyone predicted the collapse in the oil price that began two years ago, note that hardly anyone is predicting a recovery to $80 a barrel now.â 

that would have huge consequences. for a start it would be the end of deflation and lead to a much faster rise in interest rates than the markets currently expect. iâm not saying that this will happen, but the possibility that it might makes this meeting in algiers the most significant thing happening in the next few days.

second, there will be some backward-looking data on the uk economy on friday, confirming strong growth in the second quarter, and current account figures for the quarter too. more interesting will be hints about what is happening now, with a cbi distributive trades survey on tuesday, and a gfk consumer confidence survey on friday.

there will also be the index of services, telling us what has been happening in the service sector in the early post-brexit weeks. the thing to look for there, of course, will be evidence of a slowdown. my guess is that doomsayers will be disappointed; though brexit has been a shock, it will take time for that shock to work through the system. this year is going to be all right. the problem, if there is to be one, comes in 2017.

third, iâm also interested in what is happening to the housing market. on thursday there are bank of england figures for mortgage approvals. these have been very weak in recent months and expect them to continue to be so. this suggests a weakening economy, but my guess is that it has much more to do with the increase in stamp duty. if the housing market flattens, as it looks very much as though it is doing, that will be a drag on consumption next year.â 

meanwhile the us economy, always interesting, will be particularly fascinating as businesses are starting to plan for a trump presidency. uk businesses (and i think international ones with large uk interests too) did not plan for brexit. american business now is being more thorough. any news about their planning will feed back into the financial markets, though probably not into popular debate.

finally, a longer-term issue: have we reached âpeak carâ? there has been a steady retreat from driving, with peak miles driven in the us being as far back as 2005, and licences for new drivers declining in popularity in both the us and uk. this has been widely noted. but what about the importance for the motor industry, particularly in germany? might having a large motor industry become a drag on the economy, not a strength? and what does that do to german industrial pre-eminence? â a big issue in the brexit debate too.

        one of the most puzzling things about negative interest rates is why investors would accept the guaranteed loss. there are several reasons.

first, the need for security and safety may dictate investment in government bonds or insured bank deposits backed by the full faith and credit of the sovereign which retains the ability to issue currency to make repayments. the returns are relative. in europe, purchasing bonds yielding more thanâ the official rate at the central bank, even if it is negative, is the least worst option.

investors may also be attracted by the opportunity for capital gains from price appreciation if they expect yields to become more negative. foreign investors may be attracted by possible currency appreciation. investors may be driven by real rather than nominal returns. bonds with nominal low or negative returns may preserve or increase purchasing power where expected deflation is greater than the negative yield, providing positive real yields.â 

investment mandates might force fund managers to purchase negative yielding bonds, irrespective of the fact that itâ locks in a loss. and banks and insurance companies are forced to purchase negative yielding securities. liquidity regulations require them to hold high quality securities.â

we could be heading for another financial crisis



finally, central banks with restricted investment choices are also buyers of negative yielding securities. however, large and persistent negative interest rates would meet significant resistance, triggering new attempts to avoid losses.

investors can still physically withdraw cash and hold it. while theoretically feasible, that is unlikely to be a realistic option for businesses, governments and wealthy individuals. the modest size of the biggest denominations of notes (us$100 or euro 500) is one constraint. security, transport and insurance are additional constraints.â 

investors may avoid negative rates by resorting to a variety of near-cash instruments. investors would withdraw savings or creditors obtain payment by banksâ cheques which would not be banked until needed, or could be negotiated to pay for goods and services.

investors could hold savings in foreign currencies, only converting into a negative yielding currency when necessary. this strategy avoids negative yields but also entails foreign exchange risk unless it can be effectively hedged.

real assets â land, property, commodities (especially precious metals) and collectibles â would be favoured as a store of value. businesses may over-invest in inventories of production inputs which can later be used.

with negative interest rates there is an inherent incentive to make payments quickly and defer receipt of funds due. this could be extended to prepayments of taxes, suppliers or employees, where parties could pay for future obligations in advance. these strategies avoid the effect of negative yields but entail increased credit or performance risk. and it is socially and economically destructive, too. funds become tied up in unproductive assets. savings do not circulate, perversely reducing growth. capital allocation is distorted by the sole desire to avoid negative rates.

the shift out of banking deposits also affects the funding of banks. ironically, this is inconsistent with bank regulations which favour retail deposit financing of financial institutions. the reduction and instability of funding as liabilities shift to certified cheques or prepayments may reduce the ability of the financial system to extend credit, further hampering economic activity.â

the world's economic crises are entering a political stage



effective negative rates would require abolition of cash itself. to date, the case for banning cashâ has been couched in terms of deterring criminality or terrorism, eliminating tax avoidance, enhancing efficiency by faster funds flows, reducing costs or even improving hygiene by preventing contact with bacteria and virus-harbouring notes.â 

andrew haldane, chief economist at the bank of england, has explicitly argued that the presence of cash has constrained central banks from setting negative rates to stimulate a depressed economy. in a future economic or financial crisis, current low rates would restrict the effectiveness of monetary policy.

enhancing the ability to use negative rates (perhaps as high as minus 5 per cent per year) would provide central banks with additional flexibility and tools to deal with a slowdown. it would be an imaginative, rapid and durable mechanism for levying negative rates to confiscate savings.

but abolishing cash requires radical change. despite increasing reliance on electronic payment, cash is still extensively used, remaining an important medium of exchange and means of payment for legitimate, legal transactions. cash use globally remains high among the poor and older people. elimination of currency has implications for social and financial exclusion. the individual cost of converting these users to digital payments is not trivial.â 



  

libya oil exports resume after haftar takeover

an exclusively digital or electronic payment system increases security and operational risks significantly. risk of counterfeiting, cyber hacking and disruptions to operations due to technology failures are considerable.â 

in his speech advocating abolition of cash, haldane accepted that public support for banishing cash was uncertain. any such action is social and political. citizens are likely to resist the loss on anonymity and privacy. where the elimination of cash is linked to negative rates, it would be seen as a tax on savers and state confiscation of savings.â 

the intrusion of the state and authorities on this scale would become an explosive political issue.

        donald trump junior last week demonstrated that ignorant tweeting can be a hereditary trait. âif i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful? thatâs our syrian refugee problem,â explained juniorâs tweet, which was illustrated with a small bowl of the multi-coloured sweets.

as an analogy it is not only offensive but catastrophically flawed because, as many swiftly pointed out, the actual risk of an american citizen being killed by an immigrant is miniscule. the best online rebuttals involved depictions of 20-metre high bowls of skittles containing some 10 billion sweets to illustrate the actual risk of grabbing a poisoned piece of candy (ieâ of being killed by a refugee).

yet, while deprecating its nasty and irrational message, it is also worth recognising the sly way the tweet played to the way our brains often evaluate risk. the truth is we tend to wildly overestimate the incidence of terrible things such asâ terror attacks and also our chances of being caught up in them. so why do we do this?

one year on, how did we forget alan kurdi?



the way the media works is part of the answer. the broadcast news features plenty of terror attacks. people share reports of suicide bombings and rampages by brainwashed psychopaths on social media. but traffic accidents and people dying from falling over in their bathtubs donât make the evening news â even though these are far bigger hazards to most people. that skews peopleâs impressions of the chances of perishing or being caught up in such an attack.

but this isnât the whole story. we also donât tend to think of lethal risks relative to other everyday risks, but in isolation. and we think about risk in terms of how the adverse scenario makes us feel, rather than how likely it is to happen.

we respond to the intensity of the sense of fear the thought of the adverse outcome inspires. or perhaps we respond to the sense of regret it would create, or the shame we would feel, if it turned out we didnât take all the possible precautions against the adverse outcome.â 

so we have an attitude of âsafety firstâ on things such asâ terrorism (keep out all refugees in case just one turns out to be a terrorist) but not necessarily when it comes to avoiding more mundane but larger risks such as, for instance, wearing a helmet when cycling. âthe emotional tail wags the rational dog,â as psychologists say.

linked to all this isâ that we are terribly susceptible to the âframingâ of risks in marketing, or in political rhetoric such asâ trump juniorâs.â 

what does any of this have to do with economics? rational choice theory, which is still very influential among academic economic modellers, assumes that people evaluate probabilities accurately when investing or making economic decisions and also that they behave consistently over time in their choices. yet, as the biases outline above indicate, this is too simplistic and any model that relies heavily on these assumptions is liable to go awry.

the trump junior skittles analogy also emphasises how the human brain thinks about groups of people. there is often an âin-groupâ and âout-groupâ.

few (except the most deranged bigots) would argue that because there are some evil-minded americans or dangerous britons lurking out there the entire population should be locked up and aggressively screened. but we are the in-group. refugees are the out-group; different rules apply. it seems reasonable in the minds of many to treat them grossly unfairly as a group because they are something âotherâ.

donald trump threatens to bring bill clinton's former lover to preside



economists tend to be in favour of migration. as i wrote earlier this month, the empirical evidence overwhelmingly shows that when people cross borders to take up work it ends up benefiting both the host community and the immigrants.

yet people often do not think in these terms. they prefer to think instead in terms of values and culture, of in-groups and out-groups. immigrants and refugees are, sadly, often an out-group in many peopleâs minds.

it would be vain to suggest that this can be entirely eradicated by better education or appeals to reason. our brains have evolved over millennia to think in these ways about risk and groups of people. and nor is it necessarily a negative thing that values and a sense of solidarity sometimes override economic considerations, or that sometimes we, as a society, choose to react to certain risks more energetically than to others.

yet we should be alive to the thought that these biases and impulses can also lead us into some dark and dangerous places. when it seems reasonable to some to compare hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees to a bowl of poisoned sweets, there is a problem.

        âalmost wholly accurateâ is how i would describe the recent criticism of british exporters made by liam fox, trade secretary and brexiteer.â 

instead of engaging in the hysterical abuse that his remarks provoked, let us test his statements one by one, if readers will forgive a rather heavy reliance on statistics.â 

fox started by saying that âthis country is not the free-trading nation that it once was. we have become too lazy and too fat on our successes in previous generations.â while i can find no statistics for the supposed laziness of company executives, i note that, over the last decade, uk exports of goods have grown by an average of only 2.8 per cent per annum â well behind germany (+8.1 per cent) and france (+5.3 per cent). and by the way, the most recent figures for british exports are not good. between the three months to april 2016 and the three months to july 2016, exports decreased by â£1.6bn (2.2 per cent) and imports increased by â£3.3bn (3.2 per cent). â â 

at the same time, the chief executives of our leading companies have been awarding themselves handsome pay rises. last month the respected high pay centre showed that rewards at the top continue to grow at a double-digit rate. the average pay package for chief executive of big companies was â£5.48m in 2015, up from â£4.96m in 2014.â 

stefan stern, director of the high pay centre, said: âthere is apparently no end yet in sight to the rise and rise of pay packages.â would âfat cats who donât pay enough attention to exportsâ have stated the matter more fairly?



  

liam fox: this is not a game

fox went on to ask: âwhat is the point of us reshaping global trade, what is the point of us going out and looking for new markets for the united kingdom, if we donât have the exporters to fill those markets?ââ 

certainly if you look through the detail of the statistics for british exports of goods, you do find some curious patterns. we see, for instance, that uk exports to ireland are still greater than those to china and hong kong combined. total exports to sweden exceeded those to india. well, ireland and sweden are a bit nearer to us.

in fact, when britain was a âgreat free trading nationâ, to use foxâs words, british businessmen were all over china, hong kong and india. the empire followed trade, not the other way about. those 18th- and 19th-century builders of businesses wouldnât have found ireland and sweden profitable enough.â

to take another example, a recent study found that the number of uk firms exporting to latin american markets is still particularly low â especially given the scale and growth of consumption in brazil and mexico. france and germany, for instance, export substantially more pharmaceutical goods to mexico than we do. we have few historical ties with latin america, of course, but then neither does germany or france. â â 

demanding a culture change, fox added: âpeople have got to stop thinking about exporting as an opportunity and start thinking about it as a duty â [including those] companies who could be contributing to our national prosperity but choose not to, because it might be too difficult or too time-consuming, or because they canât play golf on a friday afternoon.â

the golf on a friday jibe is a bit insulting, but there is an important point here. as fox knows only too well, it will take a number of years to strike new free trade deals with non-eu countries. meanwhile, there is much that can be done immediately to improve britainâs export performance.â

an interesting analysis by ernst & young (e&y) points the way. theâ big accounting firm argues that, over the long term, the most important factor is agility. successful exporters identify and respond quickly to growth opportunities. e&y observes that in recent years, especially compared to our peers in europe, the uk failed to move either its market focus or its product portfolio quickly enough to exploit the opportunity created by the growth of the bric nations (brazil, russia, india and china). and as brazil and russia drop from the list of high-growth markets, the uk needs to be agile enough to move on to the next opportunities.

perhaps fox made his important plea in a cack-handed fashion, but the government does need urgently to challenge british business to step up to the plate in a more aggressive fashion than it has been doing.

in the dangerous post-brexit situation in which we find ourselves, starting to export, or increasing exports, should be the first item on every board agenda, at every business planning meeting and even over drinks at the clubhouse after a relaxing round of golf on a friday afternoon. â 

british prosperity is in mortal peril, and thatâs the point.

        a leading business group has slashed its forecast for economic growth amid predictions the uk faces a âsharp slowdownâ following brexit.

the british chambers of commerce (bcc) warned mounting political and economic uncertainty is likely to hit investment at the same time as consumer spending being âstifledâ, combining âto put a brake on investmentâ.

the organisation said the uk is likely to avoid a recession, but warned firms were still digesting the referendum result, implying the results of brexit may not all become immediately apparent.â 

it downgraded its growth forecast from 2.2% to 1.8% this year, from 2.3% to 1% next year and from 2.4% to 1.8% in 2018.

export growth is expected to fall to 2.3% this year from 4.8% in 2015, but slowly grow to 4% by 2018, it was predicted.

despite prime minister theresa mayâs much derided aphorism that âbrexit means brexitâ, the detail of what happens next following the referendum result remains unclear. analysts have warned this uncertainty and lack of clarity could add to the economic stagnation.â 

dr adam marshall, acting director-general of the bcc said: âalthough individual businesses continue to report strong trading conditions, the overall picture suggests a sharp slowdown in uk growth lies ahead.

âour forecast suggests that the uk is likely to avoid a recession, but with the health warning that businesses are still digesting the result of june's eu referendum and the challenges and opportunities to come.

âthe value of sterling, the shape of future trade relationships, the status of eu nationals in the uk workforce and other factors will all influence business confidence over the coming quarters.

âstability, clarity and action must continue to be the watchwords for government. aside from a clear timetable for negotiations with the eu, ministers must act to support business investment and confidence.

âthey should start with the long list of business-boosting infrastructure projects that have been put on hold for far too long - including a firm decision on a new airport runway, new nuclear investment, and road and rail schemes.

âwe also need to see policies to encourage business investment, such as revisions to our outdated business rates system, which penalises companies for investment in plant and machinery, and hits firms before they have even turned over a penny.â

suren thiru, bcc head of economics, added: âthe downgrades to our growth forecast confirm that the uk economy is set to enter a turbulent period, with growth expected to weaken materially in the near term.

âmounting uncertainty is likely to put a brake on investment, while rising inflation and moderately weaker labour market conditions are expected to stifle consumer spending. on the upside, the uk's net trade position is expected to be boosted by the post-referendum slide in the value of sterling.

        the tempo of the world of economics and finance always changes at the beginning of september. labor day, the american holiday that marks the informal end of the summer vacation season, is still a week away, but the annual meeting of the worldâs central bankers at jackson hole, in wyoming, focuses minds about the forces that will shape markets and economies in the months ahead. and this year, the prospect of us interest rates rising gives an edge. is the us â after seven years of ultra-easy money â getting back to normal? and if so, what might that mean for the rest of us?

	italy seeks new deal to scrap eu austerity as its economy stalls 
	bank of england's brexit plan to prop up the economy with qe fails on second day
	uk economy contracted after brexit vote, say leading economists



it matters because the us remains so overwhelmingly important. true, if you look at various national contributions to global growth in recent years, the emerging economies have been more important than the developed ones. but leadership comes from america. the dollar is still the anchor currency, for its only serious potential challenger, the euro, is too burdened by the specific difficulties of the european economy. so the european central bank is still expected to ease policy later this year, while the federal reserve will tighten.

what the us will do to interest rates, however, is really a subsidiary question. the primary one is: what will happen to inflation? it is very simple. if inflation raises sharply in the us, rates will rise sharply too. that applies to the uk as well, notwithstanding the recent action by the bank of england. the monetary policy committee cut rates and reintroduced quantitative easing (qe) because it thought the post-brexit economy might tank. if it does reasonably well and inflation starts to climb again, then policy will have to be reversed.

inflation predictions for the us, as elsewhere, have proved quite wrong. after seven years of spraying money around, the worldâs central banks ought to have generated massive inflation. that hasnât happened, or rather it hasnât happened to current inflation. it has happened to asset inflation, with the price of property, equitiesâ and bonds now more than 50 per cent higher worldwide than they were seven years ago. we have experienced this in britain, with house prices, sharesâ and bonds at or close to record levels, but very little rise in current prices or indeed in wages.

europe 'could go down the drain after brexit'



so the fascinating, puzzling, tantalising question concerns the links between asset inflation and current inflation. asset inflation ought to lead to current inflation, and it has in the past. you cannot sustainâ high house prices indefinitely if wages are too low for people to buy the houses. but house prices wonât fall if the central banks keep printing money and rates stay low. we donât really understand the transfer mechanism, which makes it hard to predict how things might play out now.

we do however know where to look, and that will be america. inflation in the us does seem to be creeping up. the most recent figure for current inflation is only 0.8 per cent. but core inflation, which excludes volatile items including food and energy, is now 2.2 per cent compared with 1.6 per cent at the beginning of last year. you can sketch a gradual return of headline inflation to above 2 per cent over the next couple of years. but you would have to have years of 2 per cent inflation, and perhaps 3 to 4 per cent increases in wages, to bring the relationship between pay and house prices back to where they were in the 1990s.

the implication of this is that, while the us will gradually get back to more normal interest rates and more normal inflation, interest rates will remain relatively low â relative that is to historical levels â for a long time. that is the assumption here too. but low interest rates create problems and the longer they stay low the more the problems mount. we can see that in the uk with the pressure on pension funds from ultra-low rates on government securities.

so through the autumn the world will be looking to america for guidance. can the us engineer a gradual rise in rates, allow inflation to creep up, and keep growing at a decent clip? if it does, then the rest of the developed world can expect to tag along behind. of course the uk and european policy-makers will be preoccupied by the brexit debate. to be realistic, there is likely be some negative impact from brexit on both economies, with the eurozoneâ possiblyâ taking a greater hit than the uk. but the us getting back to normal â normal growth, normal inflation, normal interest rates â would be unequivocally good news for the rest of us. normal politics? ah, that is another matter.

        big numbers are all around us, shaping our political debates, influencing the way we think about things. for instance we hear a great deal about the prodigious size of the national debt: â£1,603bn in july according to the latest official statistics.

there has been a proliferation of stories about the aggregate deficit of pension schemes, which has jumped to an estimatedâ â£1trn in the wake of the brexit vote. and how could we forget that record net migration figure of 333,000, which figured so prominently in the recent european union referendum campaign?

yet there are other massive numbers we seldom hear about. the office for national statistics published some estimates for the ânational balance sheetâ last week. this is the place to look if you want really big numbers. they showed that the aggregate value of the ukâs residential housing stock in 2015 was â£5.2 trillion â thatâs up â£350bn in just 12 months. a lot of people are considerably wealthier than they were a year ago - we should pay more attention to who they are.

thatâs property wealth. what about the total value of householdsâ financial assets? according to the ons, that stands at â£6.2 trillion â up â£113bn over the year. it will be even higher since the brexit vote. why? because those ballooning pension scheme deficits we hear about represent a part of the financial assets of households.

incidentally, a majority of the national debt, indirectly, represents a financial asset of uk households too, through the assets held by insurance companies to match their liabilities owed toâ us.

we often forget that for every financial liability there has to be a financial asset.

thereâs still a good deal of handwringing in some quarters about the supposedly excessive borrowing of the state. but we donât tend to hear anything about the debt of the corporate sector these days. the ons reports that the total debt (loans and bonds combined) of british-based companies in 2015 was â£1.35 trilion, pretty much where it was back in 2010.

if debt is something to get excited about, shouldnât company borrowing be a cause for concern? not, of course, if companies are borrowing to increase their productive capacities.

actually, the major problem with corporate balance sheets lies in a different area. the ons data shows that the corporate sectorâs overall stocks of cash rose to â£581bn in 2015, up â£41bn on last year and a sum representing an astonishing 31 per cent of our gdp. it should be seriously worrying that firms are still choosing to keep so much cash on their balance sheets at a time when we badly need them to invest.

we tend to fret about the wrong big numbers. consider the data on the liabilities of uk-based financial institutions. if you want a large number try this: â£20.5 trillion. and around a quarter of these are financial derivative contracts. many of those companies are foreign firms with uk operations. but uk banks â which we taxpayers still effectively underwrite because they are âtoo big to failâ â have aggregate liabilities worth â£7.5 trillion.â 

thatâs around four times larger than our gdp, yet mark carney, the governor of the bank of england, has rather strangely suggested he would be comfortable with that figure eventually rising to nine times national income.

stop moaning, savers â it's your fault that interest rates are so low



sometimes we fail to appreciate what lies behind the big numbers that shape our debates. the headlines this week said total uk employment grew by 172,000 in the three months to june. but this only tells one part of the story. other data from the ons showed that 478,000 people without jobs got them in the quarter, while 317,000 people entered the ranks of the unemployed. that headline figure is a net change in employment figure. and this wasnât an unusually busy quarter for the jobs market.â 

this churn goes on constantly, with hundreds of thousands of us leaving jobs and hundreds of thousands taking new ones. the economic threat from the brexit vote aftermath isnât just people being made redundant â itâs a slowdown in hiring and that mighty labour market churn.

thereâs a similar issue with those ubiquitous net migration figures. newspapers talk of immigration creating âa new city the size of newcastle each yearâ (or some variation on that line). that is rhetoric designed to stir public anxiety.

yet thatâs in context of an estimate of 36 million tourist and businessâ visits to the uk each year, flows equal to half of the british population. and there are double the number of going the other way each year.

what these big numbers emphasise is that we live in a mind-bendingly busy, complex and internationally connected economy. the figures we hear about, and which pundits fixate upon, are often the differences between two, or sometimes more, very large numbers. that bigger context should not be ignored.

the economic risks and fragilities of our economy are not always where weâre invited to believe they are.

        âneither a borrower nor a lender beâ, warned polonius. but should he have added âsaverâ to that list?â 

the bank of englandâs latest cut in its base rate has piled even more downward pressure on returns offered by banks on cash balances. santander this week halved the interest rate on its â123â account, one of the few remaining products on the market that had offered a decent return on savings.â and there is talk of another bank rate cut later this year, perhaps down to just 0.1 per cent. will it be long before furious savers march on the bankâs threadneedle street headquarters with pitchforks and burning torches in their hands?

they should put the pitchforks down.

there are a number of serious misconceptions regarding the plight of savers that have gone uncorrected for too long. the first is that âsavingâ only takes the form of cash held on deposit in current accounts (or slightly longer-term savings accounts) at the bank or building society. the truth is that far more of the nationâs wealth is held in company shares, bonds, pensions and property,â than on cash deposit.

shares and pension pots have been greatly boosted by the bankâs low interest rates and monetary stimulus since 2009. house prices have also done well, also helped by low rates. savers complain about low returns on cash, yet fail to appreciate the benefit to the rest of their savings portfolios from monetary stimulus.



  

carney on interest rates

thereâs no denying that annuity rates (products offered by insurance companies that turn your pension pot into an annual cash flow) are at historic low thanks to rock bottom interest rates. yet, since last year, savers also have the freedom not to buy an annuity upon retirement thanks to former chancellor george osborneâs regulatory liberalisation. people can now keep their savings invested in the stock market, liquidating shares when necessary to fund their outgoings.

there has been talk of the latest cut in bank base rate pushing up accounting deficits in defined benefit retirement schemes to record levels, clobbering pensioners. but this is another misunderstanding.

yes, some of these schemes, run by weak employers, could fail and need to be bailed out by the pension protection fund. and this could entail reductions in pension pay outs.â yet the larger negative impact of rising pension deficits is likely to be felt by young people in work, rather than pensioners or imminent retirees.

firms facing spiralling scheme deficits and regulatory calls to inject in more spare cash to reduce them, might well respond by keeping downward pressure on wages or by reducing hiring. in other words, the bill is likely to be picked up by those workers who are not benefiting, and were never going to benefit, from these (now closed) generous retirement schemes.

perhaps the biggest misconception about savings is that low returns on cash deposits are somehow all the fault of the bank of england. this shows a glaring ignorance of the bigger economic picture.

excess savings in the global economy â in particular from china, japan, germany and the gulf states â have been exerting massive downward on long-term interest rates in western countries for almost two decades.â to put it simply, the world has more savings than it is able to digest. it is this global 'savings glutââ that has driven down long-term interest rates, making baseline returns so low everywhere.

itâs legitimate to wonder whether further cuts in short-term rates by the bank of england will have much positive affect on the uk economy. but the savings lobby seems to believe that itâs the duty of the bank to raiseâ short-term rates, regardless of the bigger picture, in order to give people a better return on their cash savings today.â this would be madness.

yes, the bank of england could jack up short-term rates â but the most likely outcome of this would be to deepen the downturn. and for what? it would mean a higher income for cash savers, butâ survey research suggests most would simply bank the cash gainâ rather than spending it, delivering no aggregate stimulus to growth.

share and other asset prices would also most likely take a beating, undermining the rest of saversâ wealth portfolios. do savers really believe a 10 per cent fall in the value of their house is a price worth paying for a couple of extra percentage points of interest on their current accounts?

moreover, the bank of englandâs responsibility is to set interest rates for the good of the whole economy, not for one interest group within it. as andy haldane, the bankâs chief economist pointed out at the weekend, keeping rates on hold (never mind increasing them) would considerably increase unemployment. and the people who would suffer in those circumstances would probably be those who have not even had a chance to build up any savings.

stop worrying about chinaâs nuclear investment



no sensible policymaker or economist wants low interest rates for their own sake. they are a means to an end: to help the economy return to its potential growth rate. when growth has hit that target it will, in time, necessitate higher short-term rates to keep inflation in check.

so for short-term rates to rise, the economy needs to pick up speed. thatâs what the bank of england has been trying to achieve since 2009. yes, the process has been frustratingly protracted, like jumpstarting an old banger with a flat battery, but the situation would have been worse without threadneedle streetâs efforts.

if savers are frustrated with low deposit returns they should focus their anger on the global savings glut and the failure (and refusal) of governments in asia and europe to rebalance their domestic economies.â other legitimate targets are excessive domestic austerity here in britain, from the coalition and current governmentsâ since 2010, which have delivered a feeble recovery since the great recession, and also the brexit vote which has forced the bank of england into hosing the economy down with yet more emergency monetary support this month.

and if they voted for the latter two â austerity and brexit â then savers might care to look in the mirror if they want to see one of the true causes of their frustration.

																		there will be a few challenging years ahead for the u.s. stock market, one investment expert told cnbc on friday. 
															
																			    														  while the three major indexes have been hitting fresh highs since president-elect donald trump's victory in november, russell investments chief investment officer jeff hussey is predicting the s&p 500 will end 2017 at 2,100, about 8 percent lower than its current level. 
															
																			    														  one reason is the market's steep valuation, including high price-to-earnings ratios, he said in an interview with cnbc's ""power lunch."" 
															
																						
												    														  plus, profit margins are very high and they tend to revert, hussey added.  
															
																			    														  ""we think that those will be impacted both by wage growth that we're seeing and by interest rates rising,"" he said. ""a lot of financial engineering has led to high earnings per share because people bought back their shares with debt issuance.""
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		on top of that, the ""huge wall of money"" is no longer coming from the federal reserve, and that will be a challenge to the economy, hussey added. 
															
																			    														  however, anthony roth, chief investment officer at wilmington trust, thinks the normalization of fed policy is ""very positive"" for the economy and markets.  
															
																			    														  plus, he likes the reflation story right now.  
															
																			    														  ""we see inflation on the margin increasing. we see consumer sentiment quite strong. we see retail sales quite strong. that's all without additional stimulus from the new administration,"" he told ""power lunch."" 
															
																			    														  add in that fiscal stimulus and roth sees gross domestic product in the mid-3 percent range for 2017 as a whole.  
															
																			    														  ""as long as we have a dollar that's moving sideways and not hurting exports, which is our base case scenario right now, we see a really good opportunity for equities,"" he noted.

																		double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales helped push jpmorgan chase's quarterly earnings well past analysts' expectations.
															
																			    														  the company on friday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $24.333 billion. its stock price edged higher in premarket trading.
															
																			    														  analysts expected jpmorgan chase to report a profit of $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from thomson reuters. 
															
																						
												    														  the stock has been near 52-week highs since mid-december. fridays' report marks the bank's first results since the federal reserve raised its key interest rate target in a year. the fed is expected to raise them again three times this year. 
															
																			    														  jpmorgan chairman and ceo jamie dimon said as the u.s. economy builds momentum, there is opportunity for ""good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."" 
															
																			    																 
																		  ""our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses,"" dimon said in a release. 
															
																			    														  ""in the consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that president-elect donald trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. 
															
																			    														  jpmorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 12.2 percent in the latest quarter. the bank's full year net income came in at $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share. 
															
																			    														  the bank also said it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. 
															
																			    														  total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. 
															
																			    														  last year, jpmorgan surpassed wells fargo to become the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization. that change came as jpmorgan rose slightly and wells suffered the fallout of a phony customer account scandal. 
															
																			    														  on friday, wells fargo posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed on the top and bottom lines, sending shares lower nearly 1 percent in premarket trading.

																		  the price of gold eased on friday from a seven-week high touched in the previous session, as strong u.s. retail sales drove the dollar and u.s. bond yields higher, but was still on track for a third straight weekly gain. 
															
																			    														the trigger for losses after new york opened was strong u.s. economic data, which reinforced the prospect of the federal reserve raising rates this year, perhaps sooner than previously expected, traders said.  
															
																			    																 
																		  that boosted the dollar, which makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.  
															
																						
												    														it also sparked a sell-off in treasuries that drove 30-year bond yields above 3 percent, making them cheaper and more lucrative for those looking to invest in risk-free assets.  
															
																			    														gold is also seen as a risk-free asset, but it earns nothing and costs money to store and insure. 
															
																			    														spot gold was up 0.24 percent at $1,198.45 an ounce by 2:50 p.m. et, having fallen as low as $1,188.04 after the u.s. data was published. it was still up 1.9 percent on the week.    
															
																			    														u.s. gold futures were down 0.09 percent at $1,198.7. 
															
																			    														the gold price has risen 6.5 percent since a mid-december low, and touched $1,206.98 on thursday to reach its highest level since nov. 23, after president-elect donald trump failed to elaborate on his plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending. 
															
																			    														""there's clearly plenty of new long positioning that has come into the market and at these (price) levels there's room to take profit,"" said mitsubishi analyst jonathan butler. 
															
																			    														higher gold prices depressed physical sales in asia this week. in india, the world's second-largest consumer of the metal, higher prices prompted retail buyers to postpone purchases for wedding season.  
															
																			    														investors were looking ahead to trump's inauguration on jan. 20, when they will again be looking for detail on his plans for the u.s. economy. 
															
																			    														""trump's economic policies, in particular tax cuts for corporates, could lead to ever-higher equity valuations that divert funds away from bullion,"" he said. 
															
																			    														analysts at scotiabank, however, said they expect gold to strengthen further if support at $1,178 an ounce holds. 
															
																			    														several fed officials on thursday cautioned that trump's 
															
																			    														  fiscal and tax plans could spur a short-term economic boost that would result in longer-run inflation and debt problems, potentially raising demand for gold as an inflation hedge.

																		  the u.s. dollar gained against the yen and was little changed against the euro on friday, rebounding from five-week lows touched against both currencies in the prior session as u.s. retail sales data fueled expectations that the federal reserve would hike interest rates three times this year.
															
																			    														the commerce department said retail sales increased 0.6 percent in december, while november's retail sales were revised up to show a 0.2 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain.
															
																			    																 
																		  the dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent against the yen to a session high of 115.44 after slipping to a five-week low of 113.73 thursday. the dollar had fallen on wednesday and thursday on disappointment that u.s. president-elect donald trump did not address pro-growth economic policies at his first news conference since his nov. 8 election victory.
															
																						
												    														the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose as much as 0.16 percent to 101.670 after touching a five-week low of 100.720 thursday.
															
																			    														the index later turned mostly flat and was last at 101.14, but was still set to finish the week down 0.8 percent to mark its worst week since early november.
															
																			    														""we still have strong fundamental data out of the u.s.,"" said jason leinwand, founder and chief executive of firstline fx in randolph, new jersey. analysts said traders likely saw friday's data as an opportunity to buy the dollar after its dip over the past two sessions.
															
																			    														""the market has gotten over (trump's) news conference,"" leinwand said. ""so, the pullback really became an opportunity to wait for the next set of data and reposition themselves.""
															
																			    														the retail sales data also suggested the fed would follow through with its forecast in december for three projected rate hikes this year, analysts said. the u.s. central bank's rate hikes are expected to boost the dollar by driving investment flows into the united states. 
															
																			    																 
																		  ""we still think (the fed is) hiking three times this year,"" said win thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at brown brothers harriman in new york.
															
																			    														the euro was last up 0.33 percent at $1.0645 after touching a session low of $1.0597 after the u.s. data. the euro remained below a five-week high of $1.0684 touched thursday. 
															
																			    																  
																		chinese shares slid on friday as investors digested china's underwhelming exports for december and disappointing full-year trade figures. 
															
																			    														chinese exports in december decreased 6.1 percent on-year in dollar-denominated terms, while imports rose 3.1 percent from the previous year. 
															
																			    														both figures were lower than forecasts by a reuters poll of economists, which had expected exports to fall by 3.5 percent and imports to rise 2.4 percent. for the full year, china's exports dropped 7.7 percent on-year in dollar terms and imports fell 5.5 percent.

																			    														  in south korea, the kospi lost 0.5 percent or 10.35 points at 2,076.8, after the bank of korea left benchmark rates unchanged at 1.25 percent, which was aligned with expectations by a reuters poll of analysts, as it awaits for more policy clarity out of the u.s. under a trump administration. 
															
																			    														samsung group leader jay lee left the special prosecutor's office early on friday after being held for more than 22 hours for questioning over bribery suspicions in a corruption scandal, involving president park geun-hye.

																			    														  electronics entertainment company nintendo was down 5.75 percent, as the company unveiled the switch console, a hand-held hybrid with a touch-pad which was priced at at $299.99, excluding sales tax. investors had expected the price point of the new device to be about $250.  
															
																			    														  troubled airbag maker takata soared 16.47 percent or 150 points to hit its daily price limits in just thirty minutes of trading, after the journal reported that it could plead guilty by friday to criminal misconduct over defective air bags and pay nearly $1 billion to resolve the criminal probe.  
															
																			    														  the settlement would include a $25 million criminal fine, $125 million in victim compensation and $850 million to compensate automakers who suffered losses from the recalls, sources told reuters.

																		  hong kong's hang seng advanced 0.4 percent by the afternoon.

																			    														  investors also noted fed chair janet yellen avoided any remarks on monetary policy in prepared remarks at an event late thursday in the u.s., though she did later say she had no major worries on the economy over the short term. 
															
																			    														  at the same time, a downbeat reaction to a wednesday press conference by president-elect donald trump lingered. he took shots at the pharmaceutical industry and failed to provide new details on three of his key policies: tax reform, deregulation of certain sectors and fiscal stimulus. the lack of details saw traders unwind some of their trump trade, which sent stocks and the dollar lower.

																		india is expected to be one of asia's standout performers this year, as the growth outlook for the broader region looks challenging due to subdued trade, tighter financial conditions and weak capital expenditure, according to a new report from hsbc.
															
																			    																 
																		  in a comprehensive report on asia's outlook for the year, hsbc noted india could grow at an annual rate of 7.1 percent for fiscal 2018 and 7.6 percent for fiscal 2019, shrugging off any lasting effects from its program to remove 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes from the financial system in november, labelled demonetization.   
															
																			    														  the prediction is higher than asia's average 2017 growth forecast at 4.9 percent; china and the philippines are expected to grow at 6.5 percent throughout the year, while indonesia at 5.1 percent. 
															
																						
												    														for the current fiscal year that ends march 2017, growth is expected at 6.3 percent due to the short-term impacts of india's cash crunch, revised down from hsbc's previous prediction of 7.5 percent.  
															
																			    														  to be sure, india's fiscal 2018 will run from april 2017 to march 2018, while many of its peers use the calendar year to report annual data.
															
																			    																 
																		  the positive outlook on south asia's largest economy comes despite india's decision to wipe out 86 percent of the total value of currency in its cash-intensive economy late last year. hsbc's chief india economist, pranjul bhandari, noted in the report that investors were confident about india due to a much stronger macro environment. 
															
																			    														  ""inflation is in single digits, the twin deficits are under control and foreign exchange reserves are at comfortable levels,"" she said. 
															
																			    														  key reforms, and follow-up actions to them, from the government are also on the cards for india in the calendar year 2017, which could lead to further long-term gains. following the demonetization program, which was aimed at going after so-called black money or undeclared income, economists expect narendra modi's government to go after other avenues of black money including real estate, gold and foreign currencies.  
															
																			    														  the country is also set to implement reforms to replace its byzantine tax structure as early as april, though some market watchers reckon its eventual roll out could be delayed further. 
															
																			    														  ""india is likely to witness two big 'reforms' over the year - the play-out of the demonetization drive and the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) bill,""  said bhandari. ""the hope is that both of these are followed up by necessary actions, which are critical to reaping long-term gains."" 
															
																			    														  meanwhile, bhandari expects the early days of the gst implementation to be similarly disruptive like they were during the roll-out of the demonetization program.   
															
																			    																 
																		hsbc's outlook for broader asia - including australia and new zealand - is grim, influenced by expectations for sluggish export demand, tightening financial conditions and weak capital expenditure.
															
																			    														  ""it appears unlikely that exports will make a sustained recovery this year, or take over as a growth driver at a time when domestic demand continues to slow,"" said frederic neumann, co-head of asian economic research at hsbc, in the report. he pointed out declines in domestic demand resulted in intra-asia trade beginning to sputter, while the demand for asian exports in the west remained subdued. 
															
																			    														  the possibility of the u.s., under president-elect donald trump, implementing protectionist policies could have an impact on asian exporters. trump has previously said he would renegotiate existing free trade agreements, including the nafta, and threatened to impose steep tariffs on chinese imports. commentators have expressed concerns of possible escalation of a trade war between the u.s. and china, which would have broader impact on the rest of the world. 
															
																			    														  ""protectionist sentiment is strengthening, not just in the u.s. but elsewhere as well, raising the risk that restrictive measures may be increasingly adopted unilaterally,"" neumann said.   
															
																			    																 
																		  due to the challenging outlook for exports and a slowdown in domestic demand, hsbc expects capital expenditure to remain weak.  
															
																			    														  there are several factors affecting companies' decisions to invest, including the rise in protectionist rhetoric, tricky political calendars postponing tough domestic reforms and the weakening of asian currencies against the dollar pushing up funding costs for local firms.  
															
																			    														  meanwhile, rising u.s. interest rates have also resulted in capital outflows from asia, after the federal reserve raised interest rates in december and projected as many as three rate hikes for 2017. 
															
																			    														  ""for a region highly reliant on credit growth, the resulting tightening of financial conditions is a challenge...one that may grow over the coming year,"" neumann noted. 
															
																			    														  elsewhere in china, the world's second largest economy has demonstrated signs of stabilization, supported by recent economic data. last year, local government in the country announced a series of property market cooling measures in a bid to address concerns of a real estate bubble. 
															
																			    														  according to reports, several cities tightened rules for home purchases, including an increase in the initial payments new homeowners need to make to book their homes.  
															
																			    														  hsbc economists qu hongbin and julia wang said in the report they expect more policies from beijing in 2017 aimed at containing property prices in major cities. overall, they expect chinese policy to remain expansionary.

																		  amazon's announcement to create 100,000 jobs in the u.s. by 2018 on thursday marked a shift in the business paradigm for jim cramer. 
															
																			    														  ""this action reminds me of the old days when we had companies that had so much business and so much room for expansion that all you wanted was for them to keep investing in order to grow,"" the ""mad money"" host said.
															
																			    														  in response, the market rewarded amazon's stock by blowing through the $800 mark. 
															
																						
												    														  the significance of this to cramer is that amazon chose to take a path that didn't exist just a few months ago. many other stocks have taken the same action since the election after being bogged down by gridlock in washington that stifled growth.
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
																		  industrials have rallied on the belief that demand will grow with a government in washington that is no longer in the way and with the notion that donald trump will work with businesses that create jobs in the u.s. delta also confirmed its business grew in december, echoing the sentiment of united airlines. homebuilder kb home also said things have gotten better since the election. 
															
																			    														  the market will now be drawn to these kinds of stocks, cramer said. not just the companies that were oldies-but-goodies because of their consistent slow growth and decent dividend. 
															
																			    														  ""it is a seismic shift in stock picking, and amazon is the most extreme example,"" cramer said. 
															
																			    														  these days investors seem to care about who visits trump than they care about the federal reserve. trump has targeted some sectors, with pharma being the latest, but to cramer, trump is much more pro-business than president barack obama. 
															
																			    														  ""say what you want about trump's style or grace, if you think having business people surround the president will help us produce more jobs, as i do, than we are going to see a lot more growth,"" cramer said. 
															
																			    														  that means more stories like amazon will bubble up, and fewer tales about companies firing employees to make the numbers. 
															
																			    														  this marks a new paradigm. investors are now buying companies where demand has picked up and not those using artificial ways to boost their stock price. 
															
																			    														  those are the stocks cramer says to buy right now. anything else and he says you may have a loser on your hands.

																		  the election of donald trump as u.s. president has not yet switched the u.s. economy to a new ""regime"" that requires a quick rise in interest rates, which can remain ""fairly low"" at least through 2017, st. louis federal reserve bank president james bullard said on thursday.
															
																			    														  bullard said the policies outlined by trump, if well designed, could raise productivity and growth by easing regulation and taxes, and focused spending in needed infrastructure.
															
																			    														  but for now ""the policy rate should remain exceptionally low,"" through at least 2017, bullard said in remarks in new york.
															
																						
												    														  ""any effects from the new administration's policies are only likely to be observed in 2018 and 2019,"" bullard said.
															
																			    														  that includes inflation. bullard said he did not think inflation would surge in the near future.
															
																			    														  bullard in prior speeches has said he thinks the current policy rate, in a range of between .5 and .75 percentage points, is appropriate until the economy shows it has shifted to a ""regime"" of faster economic and productivity growth. 
															
																			    																 
									  
																		  faced with sharply deteriorating economic conditions in 2011 after ending their second bond-buying program,federal reserve  policymakers made an unprecedented bid to shore up the recovery by promising to keep rates low until at least mid-2013.
															
																			    														  but according to transcripts of the 2011 fed meetings released for the first time on thursday, then-fed vice chair janet yellen  wanted an even stronger statement â a vow to keep rates low not just until mid-2013, but until the unemployment rate, then at about 9 percent, fell to 7.5 percent.
															
																			    														  yellen, chair of the u.s. central bank since 2014, has resisted calls from republicans in congress to tie fed decision making on rates to a monetary policy rule that uses data on gdp and inflation to determine what interest rate the fed should target.
															
																						
												    														  but at the fed's august 9, 2011 meeting, she advocated for something along those lines herself â tying the fed's rate-setting to a threshold for the unemployment rate.
															
																			    														  the idea was ultimately abandoned in that meeting, panned by several of her colleagues, including st. louis fed president james bullard who called the idea ""super risky.""
															
																			    														  but at least two other times in 2011 yellen embraced controversial steps to ease monetary policy that, like her unemployment rate threshold idea, were initially rejected but later embraced by the policy-setting panel as a whole.
															
																			    														  in december 2011, for instance, she proposed extending the fed's low-rate promise until 2014, which it did the following month. at the same meeting she also backed further purchases of mortgage-backed securities â a plan that was later implemented in september 2012.
															
																			    														  unlike presidents of several regional fed banks, though, yellen never dissented in favor of easing, keeping the extent of her dovish views under wraps.
															
																			    														  transcripts for fed policy-setting meetings are released with a five year lag.
															
																			    														  it is likely yellen will be replaced when her current term expires in early 2018 by president-elect donald trump, who during his campaign last year accused yellen of leaving rates low to aid the obama administration.
															
																			    														  in august 2011, a few policymakers did raise concerns that a promise to leave rates low until mid-2013 could be construed as politically motivated. but most fed officials were not too concerned about that perception.
															
																			    														  instead the discussion centered more around worries that the fed's hands could be tied by a low-rate promise, although ultimately the majority did support the change. three dissented.
															
																			    														  in early 2011, yellen, like many of her fellow policymakers, expressed optimism about household spending and economic growth, but as the eurozone crisis worsened and u.s. growth slowed, she made a complete turnaround, calling the case for more easing in august ""compelling.""
															
																			    														chicago fed president charles evans said he liked yellen's idea, and even added some language of his own, suggesting that a rate hike would only be triggered if inflation, at that point lingering well below 2 percent, rose to 2.5 percent.
															
																			    														  in the end, policymakers went with the mid-2013 low-rate vow, which was, then fed chair ben bernanke said, ""the most modest possible step we could take"" in light of the worsening outlook. the following month they embarked on a limited bond-buying program known as operation twist designed to boost the economy further.
															
																			    														  the fed ultimately kept rates where they were, only just above zero, until december 2015, when the central bank hiked interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by a quarter percentage point.
															
																			    														  a month after the august 2011 fed meeting, evans went public with the idea of using an unemployment rate threshold as a guideline for monetary policy, and for the next year or so made speech after speech making the case for the approach.
															
																			    														  many months later, yellen publicly backed what by then was known as the evans rule, never letting on that it was she who first suggested it.
															
																			    														  in december 2012, the fed tied its low-rate vow to the unemployment rate for the first time, a promise it would repeat for the ensuing 12 months. 
															
																			    														
															
																			    																  
																		  aggressive fiscal and other policies could push u.s. economic growth to 4 percent in the short run, but would raise inflation risks unless coupled with strategies to boost productivity or expand the labor market, chicago federal reserve president charles evans said on thursday.
															
																			    														  evans did not mention the proposals of president-elect donald trump specifically, but said u.s. growth will remain stunted unless the labor force or productivity grow unexpectedly.
															
																			    														""the u.s. economy could experience a burst of 4 percent growth for a year,"" evans said while speaking on a panel in naples, florida. but ""it is not possible to just birth a large cohort of 25-year-olds.""

																			    														analysts warned, however, that gold's revival since mid-december may be running out of steam because the dollar was likely to rebound once trump moves forward with his economic plans.

																		  in his first media conference as u.s. president-elect, trump delivered a wide-ranging briefing that lasted longer than expected but contained no details on tax cuts and infrastructure spending, analysts said.  
															
																			    														that sent the dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major counterparts, sliding to the lowest in nearly a month, having hit a one-week high on wednesday.  
															
																			    														""it's a mess frankly, which is a reflection of the fact that there's no clarity on u.s. economic policy. the fed is as confused as the rest of us, judging from the minutes of the december meeting,"" said tom kendall, head of precious metals strategy at icbc standard bank.

																			    														trump's calls for tax cuts and more infrastructure spending have boosted u.s. shares and the dollar, as well as driving a selloff in treasuries, but his protectionist statements and a flurry of off-the-cuff tweets have kept many investors from adding to risky positions.

																			    														a higher u.s. currency, near a 14-year peak against a basket of currencies, makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.  
															
																			    														further gains for the dollar due to u.s. rate hikes during the course of the year are possible. u.s. federal reserve policy makers in december signaled the possibility of three rises this year. 
															
																			    														that may mean higher u.s. treasury yields, making it cheaper for investors to buy u.s. government bonds, which like gold are seen as risk-free. but unlike gold which earns nothing and costs to insure and store, treasuries earn regular coupons.

																			    														  they're not the only ones worried about bank valuations.  nomura, in a note today on regional banks, said,""[w]e believe share prices already discount the upside for most regional banks"" though they highlight keycorp, wells fargo, huntington bancshares, and us bancorp as possible outperformers.
															
																						
												    														  none of this is surprising, but it is refreshing hearing caution from normally upbeat analysts. banks were huge outperformers in the fourth quarter: the spdr bank etf, a basket of large banks, was up 30 percent in the fourth quarter and 25 percent since the election. 
															
																			    														  here's the problem: banks have moved so fast that there is a risk that we could have a pullback before we move higher.  they are already reflecting much of the upside from higher interest rates and the potential for lower corporate taxes and less regulation, as citi and nomura have noted.
															
																			    																 
																		  as for the fundamentals, they are not bad: 
															
																			    														the yield curve steepened after the election, but as yields have dropped in the last three weeks banks have slipped.  as for net interest margins (nim, the difference between interest income generated and the amount paid out to deposits), more rate hikes implies an improvement in nim.  how much? it'snot clear, but nomura estimates a 40 basis point improvement after five 25 basis point hikes in the fed funds rate between the first quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2019.  that is significant, considering most banks have a nim of roughly 3 percent.for most banks, loan growth is continuing in the low-to-mid-single digit range:
															
																			    														  banks: q4 loan growth(quarter-over-quarter)commercial/industrial      up 1.1%  commercial real estate  up 2.3% consumer                        up 1.5% source: susquehanna
															
																			    														  bottom line: expect banks to be moderately upbeat about the economy, the yield curve, and loan growth.  
															
																			    														  but don't be surprised if very few are willing to stick their necks out and put hard numbers around the great triumvirate of tax cuts, less regulation and stimulus programs.  bank officials are well aware of the import of lower taxes, but most have been reluctant to say anything concrete.  
															
																			    														  one of the few who has ventured to comment is terry dolan, cfo of us bancorp, who spoke at a goldman sachs u.s.financial services conference in december:  ""[i]f the tax reform ends up coming...let's say, for example, rates drop by 10 percent, what we're going to see is probably 50 percent or 60 percent of that accruing to the eps of the u.s. bank.  so, you're going to see a benefit associated with that, which enables us to have some more flexibility maybe with respect to capital or whatever may be the case."" 
															
																			    														  that, obviously, would be a significant boost to earnings. the concern is the street may be about to lean that lower taxes, repeal of the volcker rule and a massive rewrite of dodd-frank will take far longer than many expected. 
															
																			    																 
									       america's central bank raises rates to 0.75%, the second rise since the financial crisis. they were cut to almost zero after the economic crisis of 2008. the chair of the federal reserve, janet yellen, said the rise was a reflection of confidence. what she did not say - and didn't need to - was that there is a new man coming to the white house, with new economic priorities. share this with see all episodes from business matters   she said the job market had made further improvements this year and that inflation, while still below the fed's 2% target, had started to pick up. financial markets are expecting the fed to take action at a meeting next month. she also defended the independence of central banks after criticism of the fed by president-elect donald trump.  ms yellen's comments came in an appearance before a congressional committee on thursday.  it would be only the second rate rise since the bank pushed rates to a record low during the financial crisis.  in december last year, the fed raised its benchmark rate for the first time in seven years, from near zero to its current level of between 0.25% and 0.5%. ms yellen said that further delaying a rate increase would present its own risks. bbc economics correspondent andrew walker says indications that mr trump will cut taxes and spend heavily on infrastructure make it more likely that the fed will want to raise rates to contain inflationary pressures. the fed does not know yet what will happen when the president-elect and a new congress take office next year, ms yellen said.  but she added that the central bank would take into account decisions by the white house and congress when setting its interest-rate policies. she also said the us economy was ""making very good progress"", further strengthening analysts' expectations of a rate rise at the 14 december meeting. ""as a result of the testimony, we raised our subjective probability of a hike next month to 90% (from 85% previously),"" goldman sachs said. other analysts give a similar likelihood.  turning to the independence of central banks, ms yellen said they need to be able to make long term decisions that are not always popular.  in countries where central banks are subject to political pressures, there have been ""terrible"" consequences, she said. ms yellen also confirmed she planned to serve out her four-year term, which expires in january 2018. during the election campaign, mr trump criticised both the fed and ms yellen's handling of the economy. the bank of england (boe) has faced similar pressure from senior conservatives over the effects of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing since the financial crisis of 2008. former shadow chancellor ed balls on thursday called for the boe's independence to be curbed in response to growing ""popular discontent"". in an academic paper, he said central banks could ""sacrifice some political independence"" without undermining their ability to do their job.     the us central bank kept interest rates on hold last month, but the minutes revealed that it was a close call. they lend further weight to expectations of an interest rate rise by the end of the year. the dow jones and s&p 500 closed slightly higher, but the tech-heavy nasdaq dropped a little. the dow jones industrial average ended the day 15.54 points higher at 18,144.20. the wider s&p 500 index gained 2.44 points to 2,136.73, while the nasdaq slipped 7.77 points to 5,239.02. shares in apple climbed a further 0.9%. apple's shares have risen in the past few days on the expectation that iphone sales will benefit from the problems at samsung, which has cancelled production of its galaxy note 7 after a number of battery fires.    the fed said while conditions have improved, the central bank is still waiting for inflation to reach 2%.  in its statement the fed said it would ""carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal"" as it weighed when next to raise rates.  most investors expected rates to remain on hold, and were looking for changes to the fed's assessment of the economy. in its statement accompanying today's decision, the fed's open market committee pointed to strengthening in the labour market and improved household spending, as positive signs. ""labour market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the fed said.  the unemployment rate fell below 5% in january. the central bank appeared to be less focused on global financial risks to the us economy.   a slowing economy in china and falling oil prices have weighed on the fed's past decisions, but appeared to be less important this time around.  its latest update omitted the line ""global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks,"" which was included in its march statement.  ""the omission of the warning about global risks leaves the door open to a june rate hike, but whether the fed follows through will depend on what happens in financial markets over the next six weeks,"" said paul ashworth from capital economics.  us economic growth revised upward why do many americans mistrust the federal reserve? yellen: fed should 'proceed cautiously' in its statement the fed said low oil prices and poor exports early in the year had contributed to weak inflation.  additionally, while the housing sector has continued to strengthen, the fed said business investment and exports remained ""soft"". chair of the federal reserve janet yellen has continually called for a gradual adjustment to rates. but she has always maintained that the fed should consider new information as it becomes available, and stressed that the fed could raise rates at any of its future meetings. most economists only expect two rate increases in 2016. the bank's next chance to raise rates will be when it meets in june.   esther george, president of the kansas city fed, voted against the decision to keep rates on hold.  ms george said in february that interest rates should rise because the us economy was in a ""generally good position"" despite volatile movements on the stock markets.    the dow jones industrial average rose 98.62 points to 18,392.32. the s&p 500 index climbed 14.06 points to 2,177.18, while the tech-focused nasdaq index hit an intra-day high after rising 44.34 points to 5,339.52. on wednesday, the fed kept rates unchanged, although it indicated rates could rise before the end of the year. however, the fed also suggested that future rate rises will come at slower pace than previously forecast. ""the fed probably appeared less hawkish than what the markets had expected,"" said ryan larson, head of equity trading at rbc global asset management in chicago.   the fed said wednesday the case for raising rates from their historic lows had strengthened, but said it wanted to see more improvements in the job market. the dow jones industrial average rose 163.74 points to 18,293.70. the wider s&p 500 index climbed 23.36 points to 2,163.12, while the nasdaq index added 53.83 points to 5,295.18. delivery firm fedex saw its shares jump 6.89% after it reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profits. for the three months to 31 august, fedex's first quarter of its financial year, net income rose to $715m from $692m a year earlier. adobe systems rose 7.12% after its latest results also topped expectations, with revenues rising to $1.46bn in the three months to 2 september.   the number of jobs created fell from an upwardly revised 204,000 in november and came in below market expectations of 175,000 new roles. the jobless rate edged up last month to 4.7% from 4.6%.  mr trump, who takes office on 20 january, has pledged to create 25 million jobs over 10 years. the us bureau of labor statistics said that the annual rate of wage growth accelerated in december to 2.7%. this compares with a 2.5% increase in annual average hourly earnings recorded in november and is the quickest pace of growth since june 2009. the bureau revised up the number of new jobs created in november from an initial count of 178,000 to 204,000. over the last year of barack obama's presidency, job growth reached 2.2 million, down from 2.7 million in 2015.  luke bartholomew, investment manager at aberdeen asset management, said: ""job growth was decent and wage growth is picking up nicely. but the only real show in town is donald trump's inauguration.  ""the economy is doing well and doesn't obviously need the shot in the arm that trump is planning on providing. ""the interaction between the fed and trump, and the resulting policy mix, is likely to be the defining theme for investors this year."" this is the last jobs report of the obama presidency.   some of the figures for that eight-year period look pretty good. eleven million more people with jobs, and the unemployment rate down from 7.8% to 4.7%.  but then in some respects mr obama did have quite a tailwind to help him.   first of all, he came to power as the great recession was really beginning to bite. he had the benefit of the subsequent cyclical recovery you would expect anyway. the working-age population has grown, which means increased numbers with jobs are to be expected. the percentage of people (aged 16 or over) with jobs has actually come down a little although that has a lot to do with an ageing population.   and there's a case for saying that wider measures of labour market problems (people who want to work longer hours or have given up looking for work and are not counted as unemployed) are still somewhat on the high side.  the conclusion?  plenty of scope for argument about president obama's jobs legacy.  mr trump has promised to cut tax both for individuals and for businesses, as well as invest in national infrastructure. the us federal reserve indicated in the minutes from its last rate-setting meeting in december that it may have to raise interest rates at a quicker pace if congress passes mr trump's tax cuts.  the us fed has lifted interest rates just twice in the past decade, with the most recent increase to 0.5%-0.75% last month.  kully samra, uk managing director at charles schwab, said: ""despite december's non-farm payroll numbers missing forecasts, the us economy still has a robust labour market. ""the case for investment in the us remains very much intact. these figures should still be viewed as a justification of the interest rate hike last month, and we continue to expect the fed to raise rates throughout the year."" mr trump has promised to be ""the greatest jobs president god ever created"" and hopes to boost us economic growth to 4%.  since president obama's inauguration in january 2009, the number of people with jobs has increased by 11.25 million. the unemployment rate has fallen from 7.8% to 4.7%, having peaked at 10% in his first year.     mistrial in freddie gray case, qatari hunters abducted, masonic network founder dies in italy (photo: yellen making announcement, credit: getty) share this with see all episodes from the newsroom   the move takes the range of rates banks offer to lend to each other overnight - the federal funds rate - to between 0.25% and 0.5%. the move is likely to cause ripples around the world, and could increase pressure on the uk to raise rates. it could also mean higher borrowing costs for developing economies, many of which are already seeing slow growth.  rates in the us have been at near-zero since 2008.  when the fed last raised rates rate rise: reaction and analysis us rate rise: why it matters there are concerns that a rise will compound that slowdown, as higher rates in the us could strengthen the dollar, the currency in which many countries and companies borrow.  it puts us policy at odds with that in europe, where even easier borrowing terms are being implemented.  the european central bank earlier this month cut overnight deposit rates from minus 0.2% to minus 0.3% and extended a €60bn stimulus programme. the bank of england this month voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%, with its next move in interest rates not expected until late 2016. the us rate rise vote was unanimous. the us central bank also raised its projection for its economic growth next year slightly, from 2.3% to 2.4%.  that suggests the bank does not think the rate increase will damage growth. us share markets jumped in response. the dow jones went from a 50-point rise to stand up 79 points, and later added to that to close up 224 points at 17,749 points, a 1.3% gain.  it doesn't sound like much - but its significance is mighty. after nearly a decade of what has been, essentially, a global economic effort - and experiment - to save the world from financial calamity, the federal reserve, the central bank to the world's largest economy, has decided, finally, to try a touch of ""normalisation"". getting economies ""back to normal"" was always the hope during that remarkable time when the financial system was in danger of going bust. central banks around the world slashed interest rates to near zero and created billions of pounds of support for governments and the wider economy. i'm not sure anyone thought that, eight years on, we would still be in a near zero interest rate world. or, in cases such as the eurozone, a negative interest rate world. the us central bank cited as the reasons for its action increased household spending and investment by business, along with a continued low rate of inflation.  in its statement, the committee said: ""the committee judges that there has been considerable improvements in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2% objective."" the fed has said it will continue to monitor inflation and employment to determine if and when further rises are justified.  the chairman of the federal reserve, janet yellen, said the committee was confident the economy would ""continue to strengthen"" but it still has ""room for improvement"". future action will depend on how the economy moves forward and will be gradual.  ms yellen acknowledged weakness remained in the labour market, particularly wage growth.  she warned that if the fed had continued to delay a rate rise, it could have been forced to tighten monetary policy too quickly, something that could have led to another recession.   the fed's medium-term projection for the federal funds rate is 1.5% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017.  the fed will not get close to normal levels of around 3.5% until 2018 when it expects the economy will be back on a solid track: ""were the economy  to disappoint, the federal funds rate would likely rise more slowly,"" said ms yellen.   she gave little clue as to the timing of the next move, saying: ""i'm not going to give you a simple formula for what we need to raise rates again.""  tight security at the press conference seemed to add even more gravity to the importance of the announcement about to be made.  getting stuck at the security desk - while insisting zoe is your legal name - seemed like a bad omen. in fact it was an opportunity to see chair yellen up close in the moments before the announcement, as she walked past.   after every pause by janet yellen, reporters' hands shot into the air, eager for answers as to the fed's thinking. at one point a reporter lifted himself out of his chair.  most reporters' questions focused on what the fed would be looking at next. some bolder reporters though challenged whether the fed's decision was made out of vanity. one reporter asked if the fed was raising rates now because its image would be hurt if it did not.  chair yellen did not rise to the bait. despite that enthusiasm, as the last question was asked, two reporters shared a celebratory bumping of their fists under the desk. after all, the conference had gone on for more than an hour.  but when ms yellen left the room reporters stayed seated, staring at the empty podium as if waiting for another announcement.  uk rates have been held at 0.5% for more than six years. although some think the uk's central bank should act sooner than late 2016 to implement a rate rise, the uk business lobby group, the cbi, said it was unlikely to mean swifter action from the bank of england. rain newton-smith, the cbi 's director of economics, said: ""alongside the us, the uk has been one of the best-performing advanced economies in recent years, but the bank of england probably still has a way to go before rising inflationary pressures at home persuade it to follow and up interest rates."" but the institute of directors' chief economist, james sproule, said it would give the bank of england room to act. ""there will always be a thousand possible excuses not to raise rates, but...  we are probably close to peak employment in the uk, with employment growth set to plateau next year,"" he said. ""all these factors should encourage rate-setters in the uk to think seriously about raising rates in early 2016.""   the ftse 100 index rose 77 points, or 1.1%, to 6,911.4, with similar rises seen elsewhere in europe. most analysts had expected the fed to hold rates on wednesday, although the us central bank indicated rates could rise before the end of the year. the dollar fell after us rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up. that led to rises in shares of mining companies, as the price of copper hit a one-month high and other metal prices increased. shares in glencore and fresnillo led the ftse 100 higher, with both seeing rises of more than 5%. ""given the rise across the spectrum for commodities, it comes as no surprise that the ftse leaderboard is headed by some of the biggest names in mining,"" said joshua mahony, market analyst at ig. in the ftse 250, shares in kier group rose 1.3% after the construction group reported a 45% increase in underlying full-year pre-tax profits to £125m. on the currency markets, the pound rose 0.55% against the dollar to $1.3104, but was little changed against the euro at €1.166.   The Federal Reserve System (also known as the Federal Reserve or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act in response to a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) that showed the need for central control of the monetary system if crises are to be avoided. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and as of 2009 also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications, such as the Beige Book. The Federal Reserve System's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB), partially presidentially appointed Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation, numerous privately owned U.S. member banks, and various advisory councils. The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region, which entitles them to elect some of their board members. The FOMC sets monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time: the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both private and public components to serve the interests of the public and private banks. The structure is considered unique among central banks. It is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used. The Federal Reserve System considers itself ""an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."" The U.S. Government receives all the system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.   The primary motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address banking panics. Other purposes are stated in the Federal Reserve Act, such as ""to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes"". Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Today the Federal Reserve System has responsibilities in addition to ensuring the stability of the financial system. Current functions of the Federal Reserve System include: Banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reserves‍—‌amounts of currency and deposits in other banks‍—‌equal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929. Because some banks refused to clear checks from certain others during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in The Federal Reserve System‍—‌Purposes and Functions as follows: In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the lender of last resort to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector ""clearing houses"" which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs. Through its discount window and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate). By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates. For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant American International Group (AIG). In its role as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note. Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called Federal Reserve Deposits) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds. Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into federal reserve notes. Private banks maintain their bank reserves in federal reserve accounts. The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Board of Governors, summarized the history of this compromise: The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the Board of Governors are selected by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Private banks give input to the government officials about their economic situation and government officials use this input in Federal Reserve policy decisions. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board of Governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access (GAO/T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher. The Board of Governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve: The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the Board of Governors. This policy is described in United States Code: The Federal Reserve plays an important role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities. In the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services. It also encourages competition between the Reserve Banks and private-sector providers of payment services by requiring the Reserve Banks to charge fees for certain payments services listed in the act and to recover the costs of providing these services over the long run. The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients‍—‌individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the Fedwire Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service. Because of the large amounts of funds that move through the Reserve Banks every day, the System has policies and procedures to limit the risk to the Reserve Banks from a depository institution's failure to make or settle its payments. The Federal Reserve System has a ""unique structure that is both public and private"" and is described as ""independent within the government"" rather than ""independent of government"". The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the Federal Reserve Act, which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal. The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are (1) the Board of Governors, (2) the Federal Open Market Committee, (3) the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and (4) the member banks throughout the country. The seven-member Board of Governors is a federal agency. It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It also supervises and regulates the U.S. banking system in general. Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms. One term begins every two years, on February 1 of even-numbered years, and members serving a full term cannot be renominated for a second term. ""pon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified."" The law provides for the removal of a member of the board by the President ""for cause"". The board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the President chooses, until their terms on the Board of Governors expire. The current members of the Board of Governors are as follows: In late December 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Jeremy C. Stein, a Harvard University finance professor and a Democrat, and Jerome H. Powell, formerly of Dillon Read, Bankers Trust and The Carlyle Group and a Republican. Both candidates also have Treasury Department experience in the Obama and George H. W. Bush administrations respectively. ""Obama administration officials  regrouped to identify Fed candidates after Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, withdrew his nomination to the board in June  in the face of Republican opposition. Richard Clarida, a potential nominee who was a Treasury official under George W. Bush, pulled out of consideration in August "", one account of the December nominations noted. The two other Obama nominees in 2011, Yellen and Raskin, were confirmed in September. One of the vacancies was created in 2011 with the resignation of Kevin Warsh, who took office in 2006 to fill the unexpired term ending January 31, 2018, and resigned his position effective March 31, 2011. In March 2012, U.S. Senator David Vitter (R, LA) said he would oppose Obama's Stein and Powell nominations, dampening near-term hopes for approval. However Senate leaders reached a deal, paving the way for affirmative votes on the two nominees in May 2012 and bringing the board to full strength for the first time since 2006 with Duke's service after term end. Later, on January 6, 2014, the United States Senate confirmed Yellen's nomination to be Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors; she is slated to be the first woman to hold the position and will become Chair on February 1, 2014. Subsequently, President Obama nominated Stanley Fischer to replace Yellen as the Vice Chair. In April 2014, Stein announced he was leaving to return to Harvard May 28 with four years remaining on his term. At the time of the announcement, the FOMC ""already is down three members as it awaits the Senate confirmation of ... Fischer and Lael Brainard, and as  Obama has yet to name a replacement for ... Duke. ... Powell is still serving as he awaits his confirmation for a second term."" Allan R. Landon, former president and CEO of the Bank of Hawaii, was nominated in early 2015 by President Obama to the board. In July 2015, President Obama nominated University of Michigan economist Kathryn M. Dominguez to fill the second vacancy on the board. The Senate had not yet acted on Landon's confirmation by the time of the second nomination. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the Board of Governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the Chair of the Board of Governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed. The Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction. There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks and they are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Each reserve Bank is responsible for member banks located in its district. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed. Each regional Bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their Bank. Each regional Reserve Bank's president is nominated by their Bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the Board of Governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed. Each regional Bank's board consists of nine members. Members are broken down into three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank's shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks' interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region's member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the Board of Governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public. A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank), upon meeting certain standards. About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank. The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus. However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Member banks, do however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks' boards of directors. From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member, a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6% of their purchased stock. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary. In Lewis v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: ""The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA , but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations."" The opinion went on to say, however, that: ""The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes."" Another relevant decision is Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the Board of Governors, which is a federal agency. Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written that: According to the website for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, ""ore than one-third of U.S. commercial banks are members of the Federal Reserve System. National banks must be members; state chartered banks may join by meeting certain requirements."" The GAO and an outside auditor regularly audit the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve banks, and individual member banks. Audits do not cover ""most of the Fed's monetary policy actions or decisions, including discount window lending (direct loans to financial institutions), open-market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee"" ... ""dealings with foreign governments and other central banks."" Various statutory changes, including the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, have been proposed to broaden the scope of the audits. As of August 27, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board has been publishing unaudited financial reports for the Federal Reserve banks every quarter. This is an expansion of prior financial reporting practices. Greater transparency is offered with more frequent disclosure and more detail. November 7, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. News brought a lawsuit against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to force the board to reveal the identities of firms for which it has provided guarantees during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Bloomberg, L.P. won at the trial court and the Fed's appeals were rejected at both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The data was released on March 31, 2011. The term ""monetary policy"" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States. The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the federal funds rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of excess reserves. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three ""tools"" of monetary policy described in the Tools section below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005: Effects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth. There are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks: 
The Federal Reserve System implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time. Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of United States Treasury security, sometimes called ""Treasury bills"" or more informally ""T-bills"" or ""Treasuries"". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions. The Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows: To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days. The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the ""discount rate"", which is the interest rate for ""discount window lending"", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the ""discount rate"" option. The equivalent operation by the European Central Bank is referred to as the ""marginal lending facility"". Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the prime rate, which is usually about 3 percent higher than the federal funds rate. Another instrument of monetary policy adjustment employed by the Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, also known as the required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve. As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gives the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC. In order to address problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007. It was first announced as a temporary tool but there have been suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time. Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy. The differences between these three new facilities is described by the Federal Reserve: Some measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address this mortgage crisis have not been used since The Great Depression. The Federal Reserve gives a brief summary of these new facilities: A fourth facility, the Term Deposit Facility, was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. The Term Deposit Facility allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system. The Term Auction Facility is a program in which the Federal Reserve auctions term funds to depository institutions. The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. The reason it was created is that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the discount window because it is usually associated with the stigma of bank failure. Under the Term Auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds is protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure. Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U.S. dollars. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefly described this facility to the U.S. House of Representatives on January 17, 2008: It is also described in the Term Auction Facility FAQ The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28-day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. It is anticipated by Federal Reserve officials that the primary dealers, which include Goldman Sachs Group. Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley, will lend the Treasuries on to other firms in return for cash. That will help the dealers finance their balance sheets. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an overnight loan facility that will provide funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now primary dealers can borrow directly from the Fed when this used to be prohibited. As of October 2008, the Federal Reserve banks will pay interest on reserve balances (required and excess) held by depository institutions. The rate is set at the lowest federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period of an institution, less 75bp. As of October 23, 2008, the Fed has lowered the spread to a mere 35 bp. The Term Deposit Facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks will offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. By removing ""excess deposits"" from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that: The Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five ""small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures."" After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis. The Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News: Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms: The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB. Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria: On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper using the new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF. A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative policy. With that the Federal Reserve actually buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business. The Federal Reserve Board used this policy in the early 1990s when the U.S. economy experienced the savings and loan crisis. The bursting of the United States housing bubble prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25 trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages. The first attempt at a national currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775 the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills ""Continentals"". The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28. In 1791, the government granted the First Bank of the United States a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811. The First Bank of the United States came to an end under President Madison because Congress refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England. Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day. The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on February 25, 1791, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton. This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, because Congress refused to renew it. In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the Second Bank of the United States. Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Nicholas Biddle, President of the Second Bank of the United States, responded by contracting the money supply to pressure Jackson to renew the bank's charter forcing the country into a recession, which the bank blamed on Jackson's policies. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the debt. The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, in the Free Banking Era there was no formal central bank. From 1846 to 1921, an Independent Treasury System ruled. From 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act during which series of bank panics, in 1873, 1893, and 1907 occurred The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the Panic of 1907, which caused renewed demands for banking and currency reform. During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the United States economy went through a series of financial panics. According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an inelastic currency and a lack of liquidity. In 1908, Congress enacted the Aldrich–Vreeland Act, which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform. The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress. A revision crafted during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nation's top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the Federal Reserve Act. The House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 yeas to 60 nays, and the Senate voted 43–25 on December 23, 1913. President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill later that day. The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich. Aldrich set up two commissions – one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them. Aldrich went to Europe opposed to centralized banking, but after viewing Germany's monetary system he came away believing that a centralized bank was better than the government-issued bond system that he had previously supported. In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. Paul Warburg, an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was ""bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties"". After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the ""Aldrich Plan"", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible. The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors. Aldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan, but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the ""eastern establishment"". In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply. Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control. The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress. Nonetheless, President Woodrow Wilson believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator Robert Owen in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the Board of Directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government. The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913, on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting ""yea"" and most Republicans voting ""nay"". Key laws affecting the Federal Reserve have been: The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the Board of Governors Economic Data and Research page, the Board of Governors statistical releases and historical data page, and at the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy. Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and Lawrence H. White objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo. The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled Flow of Funds. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was $95.5 trillion. The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows: The Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information. The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail. The Personal consumption expenditures price index, also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including United States Consumer Price Index and U.S. Producer Price Index prices, it is derived from the largest component of the Gross Domestic Product in the BEA's National Income and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures. One of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success. Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent. There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific inflation targeting policy. Most mainstream economists favor a low, steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation may reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation's economic health. The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast majority (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as ""capital gains/losses"" that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans. The Board of Governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses as well as the net profit or loss is the large report simply titled, ""Annual Report"". It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called ""Annual Report: Budget Review"". These are comprehensive reports with many details and can be found at the Board of Governors' website under the section ""Reports to Congress"" One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or balance statement). In accordance with Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the ""Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks"" showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The Board of Governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes. Below is the balance sheet as of July 6, 2011 (in billions of dollars): NOTE: The Fed balance sheet shown in this article has assets, liabilities and net equity that do not add up correctly. The Fed balance sheet is missing the item ""Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks"" which would make the figures balance. In addition, the balance sheet also indicates which assets are held as collateral against Federal Reserve Notes. The Federal Reserve System has faced various criticisms since its inception in 1913. Critique of the organization and system has come from sources such as writers, journalists, economists, and financial institutions as well as politicians and various government employees. Criticisms include transparency, doubt of efficacy due to what is seen by some as poor historical performance and populist concerns about the debasement of the value of the dollar. From the beginning, the Federal Reserve has been the subject of many popular conspiracy theories, that typically link the Fed to numerous other supposed conspiracies. Bundled references  "
2,Us Election,"
        the army general who heads the d.c. national guard and has an integral part in overseeing the inauguration said friday that he will be removed from command effective at 12:01 p.m. jan. 20, just as donald trump is sworn in as president.

maj. gen. errol r. schwartzâs departure will come in the middle of the presidential ceremony â classified as a national special security event â and while thousands of his troops are deployed to help protect the nationâs capital during an inauguration he has spent months helping to plan.

âthe timing is extremely unusual,â schwartz said in an interview friday morning, confirming a memo announcing his ouster that was obtained by the washington post. during the inauguration, schwartz will command not only members of the d.c. guard but also 5,000 unarmed troops dispatched from across the country to help. he also will oversee military air support protecting washington during the inauguration.

âmy troops will be on the street,â said schwartz, who turned 65 in october. âiâll see them off, but i wonât be able to welcome them back to the armory.â he said he would ânever plan to leave a mission in the middle of a battle.â

unlike in the states, where the governor appoints the national guard commander, in the district that duty falls to the president.

military officials and trump transition officials provided contradictory versions of the decision to replace schwartz. as is customary for presidential appointees, the general submitted a letter of resignation to give the new administration a clean start.

two military officials with knowledge of the situation said the trump team decided to accept the resignation. a person close to the transition said transition officials wanted to keep schwartz in the job for continuity, but the army pushed to replace him.

schwartz, who was appointed to head the guard by president george w. bush in 2008, maintained the position through president obamaâs two terms. he said his orders came from the pentagon in the form of an email that names his interim successor, a brigadier general, who takes over at 12:01 p.m. next friday.

army maj. jamie davis, a spokesman at the defense department, said schwartz is classified as a ânon-career status employee.â he noted that the interim commander âis ready to assume complete missionâ and handle the inauguration.

one of the military officials said the trump transition team receives lists of political appointees and can decide which resignations to accept. all resignations are effective at 12:01 p.m. on inauguration day.

d.c. council chairman phil mendelson (d) blasted the decision to remove schwartz, particularly during the inauguration.

âit doesnât make sense to can the general in the middle of an active deployment,â mendelson said. he added that schwartzâs sudden departure will be a long-term loss for the district. âheâs been really very good at working with the community, and my impression was that he was good for the guard.â

schwartz said he will work up until that moment, and then plans to retire from the army. âiâm a soldier,â he said. âiâm a presidential appointee. therefore, the president has the power to remove me.â

like other deployments, inauguration day will be a complicated one for the d.c. national guard â at least on paper. since the district is not a state, its mayor cannot call up guard members to active duty as a state governor can.

the district must send a letter to the secretary of the army requesting the support. the district and the army must then go through a seven-step process to initiate the deployment, during which guard members carry out duties at the request of the mayor and city homeland security officials.

the two entities have been able to work together to make that happen quickly in response to unfolding natural disasters, such as last yearâs record january snowfall. during that storm, which dumped 22 inches of snow, the guard was activated in anticipation of the stormâs arrival, and troops helped shuttle officials, plow drivers and supplies back and forth across the city.

schwartz began his military career in 1976 by enlisting in the guard, formally called the militia of the district of columbia national guard. he also oversees the air national guard, which combined with the army guard has an authorized strength of 2,700. he has served in several leadership positions, notably commanding the 372nd military police battalion.

he graduated in 1980 from the university of the district of columbia with a degree in electrical engineering and received a masterâs degree in business management from central michigan university and in national security strategy from the national defense university at fort mcnair in the district.

schwartz said that he is most proud of the youth challenge academy, a school for teenage dropouts run by the guard with an infusion of federal money. the school, separate from d.c. public and charter schools, is located at the former oak hill facility, the districtâs old juvenile jail. schwartz said that about 60 percent of the student body have obtained high school diplomas, and some have gone on to college.

kestutis girnius, associate professor of the institute of international relations and political science in vilnius university, told afp -this graffiti expresses the fear of some lithuanians that donald trump is likely to kowtow to vladimir putin and be indifferent to lithuanias security concerns. trump has notoriously stated that putin is a strong leader, and that nato is obsolete and expensive.

        donald trumpâs national security adviser has been in âvery frequentâ contact with russiaâs ambassador to the us, and the pair spoke on the day barack obama imposed sanctions on russia for its part in election hacking, according to a senior us official.â 

mr trumpâs team initially denied that michael flynn and russiaâs ambassador sergey kislyak spoke on 29 december, but later admitted that oneâ call had been made on that dayâ and another call made the day before.

however, reuters reports that three different sources familiar with the situation said five calls were made between the pair on the day the sanctions were imposed.â 

the cosy relationship has raised questions about whether repeated contact with the president-electâs team has helped shape moscowâs response to the imposition of sanctions.



  

trump's message to putin

following the enforcement of the sanctions, in which washington expelled 35 russian diplomats, vladimir putin did not retaliate, and instead said he would not deport us diplomats in response.

mr trump described mr putinâs actions as âvery smartâ, putting himself at odds with his own countryâs government, its intelligence service and with his own party.â 

the president-electâs stance has prompted outrage in washington, including among republicans, after us security officials advised that russia had been behind a hacking operation aimed at influencing the us election to benefit mr trump.â 

mr trump has already indicated he may lift the sanctions once he takes office.

âif russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions?â he asked in an interview with the wall street journal.


great move on delay (by v. putin) - i always knew he was very smart!
â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) december 30, 2016
during an earlier press conference, he emphasised his rapport with the russian leader.â 

âif putin likes donald trump, i consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with russia,â mr trump said.

intelligence committee to probe trump team over alleged russia ties



mr flynnâs regular contact with mr kislyak suggests mr trumpâs desire to build closer ties with russia is well underway despite mounting concerns over the nature of the relationship.

the shifting accounts of mr flynnâs contact with mr kislyak, have also done little to alleviate the worries of many in washington.â 

according to the associated press, one of mr trumpâs officials confirmed mr flynn and mr kislyak had spoken by phone on 29 december, following a text message from the ambassador the day before. during the call, the russian ambassador invited us officials to a conference on syria later this month in kazakhstan.â 

the official also confirmed a phone call between the men earlier in december.â 

a separate us official who spoke to the associated press on friday described the contact between the two men as âvery frequentâ.



  

boris johnson 'not worried' about trump and putin's relationship

the revelations of close ties with russia come immediately after the cia warned that russia may hold more than one recording of compromising footage of mr trump, containing video and audio of a sexual nature, which could be used to blackmail him.â 

the allegations follow the publication of documents compiled by a former british spy who the cia described as a âcredibleâ source.â 

ex-mi6 officerâ christopher steele, 52, reportedly prepared the documents for mr trumpâs democratic and republican opponents during the us presidential primary election.

kestutis girnius, associate professor of the institute of international relations and political science in vilnius university, told afp -this graffiti expresses the fear of some lithuanians that donald trump is likely to kowtow to vladimir putin and be indifferent to lithuanias security concerns. trump has notoriously stated that putin is a strong leader, and that nato is obsolete and expensive.

                a passerby photographs a mural showing u.s. president-elect donald trump (r) blowing marijuana smoke into the mouth of russian president vladimir putin on the wall of a bar-b-que restaurant on november 23, 2016 in vilnius, lithuania. many people in the three baltic nations of lithuania, latvia and estonia are concerned that russia, because trump has expressed both admiration for putin and doubt over defending nato member states, will be emboldened to intervene militarily in the baltics.

the claims were deemed grave enough for both president obama and the president-elect to receive security briefings on the documentâs content.

after the documents were published in full by buzzfeed, mr trump took to twitter to denounce the allegations as âfake newsâ, and asked: âare we living in nazi germany?â

        with just nine days to go until his inauguration as president of the united states, donald trump has again found himself at the centre of a scandal involving alleged links to the russian state.

a classified briefing on russian hacking, given to both president barack obama and the president-elect, included allegations that mr trump or his surrogates had direct contact with the kremlin before and during the 2016 election campaign.

and the report also details ""perverted sexual acts"" involving prostitutes alleged to have taken place in a hotel room in moscow. the suggestion is that the claims could have been used by russia to compromise the incoming us president.

mr trump has strenuously denied the unverified allegations, which came in a two-page synopsis attached to a classified intelligence report into russian interference in the us election. a declassified version was distributed publicly last week.



  

trump chief adviser kellyanne conway denies compromising claims against president-elect

intelligence officials said they could not independently verify the embarrassing claims, compiled by a former british spy who was hired by mr trumpâs political opponents.

the kremlin dismissed the report as ""fake"" and ""total bluff"" in a statement on wednesday morning, saying it had no ""compromising information"" on either mr trump or his 2016 rival hillary clinton. on tuesday night, mr trump's political advisor kellyanne conway also dismissed the claims as coming from ""unnamed, unspoken sources"".


fake news - a total political witch hunt!
â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 11, 2017
the allegations have been circulating among intelligence agencies for some months and were in part reported upon before the election, but they have now been presented to the president and president-elect in greater detail because officials have performed checks on the former british spy and his sources and found them largely credible, cnn reported.

while stressing that the sexual claims remain unverified, buzzfeed news published the classified two-page synopsis in full online. the site saysâ itâ published the unsubstantiated allegations so americans could make up their own minds.

the potentially compromising allegations emerged on the same night as mr obama gave his final presidential address, and ahead of a scheduled news conference on wednesday afternoon in which mr trump was supposed to discuss his business empire and potential conflicts of interest. that conference was, as of wednesday morning, still going ahead.

dozens of memos have been compiled by the former british operative, beginning as opposition research by mr trumpâs rivals for the republican candidacy, unnamed security sources told cnn.

russia denies claims it is holding compromising material about trump



the former mi6 agent reportedly served in russia during the 1990s. his investigation into the new york businessman started during the gop primaries, and was then taken up by liberal groups and donors once mr trump became the presidential nominee.â 

much like the declassified report released on friday, the two-page synopsis of the memos did not include details about sources or methods.â 

the documents have apparently circulated for months among top senators and intelligence officials. journalists who obtained the documents had for weeks been unable to corroborate the contents.â 

the unverified, scanned memo alleges that russia had ""cultivated"" mr trump to be a presidential candidate over the past five years; that he was allegedly bribed with various lucrative real estate deals in russia, although he had turned them down; plus the sexual claims that could compromise him personally.



  

obama's only mention of trump in his farewell speech

former senate minority leader harry reid alluded to the memos in a fiery letter to fbi director james comey at the end of october last year, following his unusual announcement about a further clinton email probe 11 days before the election.

""in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump, his top advisors, and the russian government,"" mr reid wrote at the time. ""the public has a right to know this information.""

last month, president obama ordered the intelligence community to deliver a full report into russia's role in the hacking of democratic institutions.

the declassified report released last week concluded that: ""[vladimir] putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the us presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process, denigrate secretary [hillary] clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.â â  â  â  â  â  â 

prior to his briefing with intelligence chiefs, mr trump had tried to fervently discredit the assessment that russian operatives â directed by mr putin â had hacked the democratic national committee and clinton campaign chair john podesta in a widespread campaign to help him win the election.

""while russia, china, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses, and organisations including the democratic national committee,"" mr trump said in a statement, ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.""

intelligence officials maintained that, while russian hackers did not tamper with vote tallies or machines, they could not gauge the influence the email leak and disinformation campaign had on voters' ultimate decisions.â 

the report stated: ""we did not make an assessment of the impact that russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.""

        in a political environment where every action generates an equal and opposite reaction, restaurants that want to signal their discomfort with the policies of the incoming trump administration have to orchestrate their moves carefully during inauguration weekend. anything labeled, or just perceived, as a protest could meet with significant backlash.

so this week, as nandoâs peri-peri begins to hand out #everyoneiswelcome posters at six washington restaurants, the south african-portuguese chicken chain is pitching the campaign as a statement of corporate values, not a slap at president-elect donald trump and his supporters. those who voted for trump, of course, may take a different view of the poster, whose language on the back reads:

ânandoâs peri-peri is an

immigrant employing

gay loving

muslim respecting

racism opposing

equal paying

multicultural

chicken restaurant where #everyoneiswelcome.â

	donald trump says 'media is fake' in response to press criticism 



âitâs a bold and brave statement, but itâs true and honest and it represents who we are as a brand,â says burton heiss, chief executive of nandoâs usa, a washington-based company.

nandoâs origins in 20th-century south africa, where the majority-black population was disenfranchised and destitute, has informed how the company views the world in the 21st century, heiss notes. âover the years, the company saw firsthand the devastating impact of apartheid and a system that devalued diversity and made it a point to speak out against such beliefs,â he says. the company âhas long been an activist organization in terms of its speaking out against such regimes.â

but during an interview, heiss repeatedly emphasizes that the nandoâs campaign is designed to be inclusive, not divisive, an invitation for thousands of inauguration visitors to learn more about a growing chain that operates dozens of restaurants in the d.c., baltimore and chicago markets. on wednesday, the company plans to tuck 60,000 posters inside the express, the washington postâs free daily commuter paper, in the hopes readers will display the pages. the posters will also be available for download at everyoneiswelcome.us. the front of the sheet will have no obvious branding, other than the red heart thatâs part of nandoâs poultry-based logo, as well as the hashtag #everyoneiswelcome.

âall we can do is be honest that #everyoneiswelcome means everyone is welcome,â heiss says. âregardless of what we have said, there are differences of opinions. but that doesnât mean we canât break bread together and maybe even have a discussion about those differences.â

nandoâs careful messaging â aimed at expressing its progressive beliefs without alienating trump supporters or, worse, generating their ire â looks like the same kind of balancing act practiced by other restaurants that want to take a stand, or whatever they call it, during the inauguration. to date, more than 30 establishments have joined the all in service dc campaign started by amanda carpenter and alaina dyne, a pair of front-of-the-house veterans who are asking d.c. bars and restaurants to support a charity of their choosing during inauguration weekend.

the charities selected so far have a certain, well, stick-it-to-the-man quality. they include planned parenthood (which republicans have threatened to defund) and ayuda, which provides legal and social services to low-income immigrants. contributing to an immigrant advocacy group makes sense for a restaurant, notes ian hilton, co-owner of chez billy sud in georgetown, one of the participating restaurants. many commercial kitchens and dining rooms couldnât function without immigrants, some of whom are feeling uneasy about the incoming president and his deportation plans.

âwe see the anxiety in our employees, for the obvious reason,â says hilton.

estate agents say a nando's can be a deal-breaker for house buyers



at the same time, hilton says he has no stomach for political statements that degrade the highest office in the land. he wants his participation in all in service dc to be apolitical.

âyou might not always be happy with how an election turns out, but you have to turn a page and kind of hope for the best and think positively,â he says. âwhether i personally felt bad on the wednesday after election day, what do you do? you move on.â

emphasizing the apolitical nature of their inauguration activities could be a survival instinct for restaurants. there has been plenty of evidence that customers are quick to punish businesses that take a position, pro or con, on a candidate. once-faithful yuengling bars and drinkers vowed to dump the brand after the owner of the historic pennsylvania brewery endorsed trump. grubhub, the food delivery service, suffered a similar fate when its chief executive sent an email to employees after the election, suggesting that anyone who shared trumpâs attitudes toward minorities, women and the disabled should resign. the companyâs stock fell by 5 percent in response.

ben & jerryâs, the socially conscious ice cream chain owned by unilever, released an open letter to the president-elect two days after trump won. the vermont-based company had actually written two letters, one for each voting outcome, but âhad put more time and energy into the other letterâ for hillary clinton, says chris miller, activism manager for ben & jerryâs. so when trump won, miller and his content team shifted into overdrive to complete a draft letter and send it through the company ranks for approval.

the final letter was mostly magnanimous, but at the end, ben & jerryâs reiterated its values, including its support for âwomen, people of color, muslims, migrants, refugees, the lgbtq community, the poor.â the company indicated it would support trump if he were committed to âbuilding a more just, equitable, and sustainable world.â

for the month of november, âthis was far and away the most trafficked pageâ on the ben & jerryâs site, miller says. the public response, he adds, was âoverwhelmingly positive,â but it also generated some pointed facebook commentary. âthis is ridiculous,â one poster wrote. âyou guys sell ice cream. donât you have a different page for politics? iâm out of here!â

but ben & jerryâs doesnât shy away from controversy, miller says, as in october when the company issued a statement on the importance of the black lives matter movement that immediately struck a nerve with police supporters. the group blue lives matter quickly called for a nationwide boycott of ben & jerryâs products. miller says such responses are the price ben & jerryâs pays for its activism.

âwe firmly believe that itâs better to be intensively loved by some than inoffensive to everyone,â miller says. such a position, he adds, is not always easy on those who answer the phones at headquarters.

not everyone shares ben & jerryâs taste for politics, not even in the district, where politics is the only game that matters. even liberal-minded restaurants donât always feel comfortable raising their blue flag in the city where more than 90 percent of the voters cast a ballot for hillary clinton. their reticence is tied not just to inauguration weekend, which will bring together trump supporters and protesters, two sides that historically have not mixed well. itâs also tied to the recent #pizzagate madness, in which hacked emails, fake news stories and false rumors about a pedophilia ring run by clinton eventually led to a gunman appearing at comet ping pong pizzeria on connecticut avenue nw.

the #pizzagate episode has been so horrific that comet owner james alefantis will still not speak publicly about it. âtrying to stay out of the fray,â he texts.

cometâs woes have had an effect. restaurateurs are willing to stick their necks out only so far, but theyâre also not inclined to remain silent. âwe all know what recently happened with comet ping pong,â says sarah massey, spokeswoman for all in service dc. âthatâs not going to deter our community from doing the right thing.â

and now nandoâs has willingly stepped into this fray, not with a fundraising campaign for charity but with posters that promote diversity, equal pay and multiculturalism, subjects that can be flashpoints for trump supporters. the chicken chain is not naive about the political landscape. it has been preparing its staff on how to handle tough and/or rude questions.

        the office of government ethics is struggling to investigate the backgrounds of donald trumpâs cabinet selections and theyâre accusing republicans of pushing confirmation hearings forward while they search for potential criminal, ethical and financial conflicts.

on saturday, director walter shaub jr wrote a letter to senate democrats highlighting his concerns: âthis schedule has created undue pressure on ogeâs staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.â while he didnât mention any of the nominees by name, several of trumpâs picks are millionaires (and even billionaires) with wide-ranging financial ties that the office is struggling to untangle.

republicans will begin hearings on tuesday, leaving the cabinet picks with potentially unresolved ethical issues. âi am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since oge was established when the senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process,â he wrote.

senator richard blumenthal, a democrat from connecticut, condemned the trump transition team citing a lack of cooperation with the ethics committee.

âwe should put all of these on hold until the background checks by the fbi and the ethics office reports are completed,â he told the washington post. however, trumpâs transition team accused the office of politicizing the confirmation process.

""president-elect trump is putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly,"" his team said in a statement to cbs news.

""in the midst of a historic election where americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing the country. this is a disservice to our country and is exactly why voters chose donald j trump as their next president.""

in an interview with fox news sunday, reince priebus, trumpâs incoming chief of staff, was asked if the administration would consider delaying the confirmation hearings until the background checks were finished.

âno,â he said. âthey have to get moving. i mean, they have to move faster. and they have all the information. these are people that have been highly successful in their lives. they need to move quicker.â

âthe fact is thereâs no reason,â he continued. âi mean, itâs the first week of january, they have all the details that they need, they have all the information that they need. itâs no different from any other new administration coming in and the american people demand it. change was voted for and change we will get.â

        president-elect donald trump seemed to dismiss the white house announcement of sanctions against russia by saying that americans should get on with their lives.

on thursday, the obama administration announced public and secret measures against moscow for alleged meddling in novemberâs presidential election. us intelligence agencies have accused russia of hacking the democratic partyâs email servers to help trump win the presidency.

""it's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,"" mr trump said in a statement thursday. ""nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, i will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.""

        todayâs us sanctions against russia â including the expulsion of 35 diplomats and the closure of two russian intelligence gathering sites in maryland and new york â are much stiffer than expected. taken in response to the alleged kremlin-ordered hacking of the recent presidential election here, they underline how relations between the two former superpowers are now at their worst since the early 1980s, during the last spasm of the cold war.

â although russia, which has denied the charges, is likely to respond in kind, the repercussions of the incident could be fairly short lived, given that the new administration of donald trump, who has poured scorn on the hacking claims and vowed to improve ties with moscow, is just 22 days away.

white house sanctions russia over election hacking



â nonetheless, they will surely greatly complicate life for the president-elect. not only do president obama and the democrats, the victims of the hacking, believe such measures are overdue. so do senior congressional figures of mr trumpâs republican party, including house speaker paul ryan and several senators, led by arizonaâs john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee. even before todayâs announcement, pressure has been building on capitol hill for a special committee, akin to the 1973 watergate committee, to examine the matter further.

â at the very least, the dramatic expulsions â and the certainty of tit-for-tat measures by moscow â ensure the future of us-russian relations will be front and centre of the confirmation hearings next month of rex tillerson, mr trumpâs nominee for secretary of state, who as head of exxonmobil had close ties with the kremlin, and of congressman mike pompeio, named to take over the cia.

â measured by numbers alone, the expulsions appear to be the largest such exercise since 2001, when washington ordered out 50 russian personnel after the capture of robert hanssen, the fbi counter intelligence agent who had spied for the soviet union and then russia for more than 20 years.

â us officials moreover believe the election hacking, most notably of the democratic national committee and the personal email account of john podesta, hillary clintonâs campaign chairman, was but the culmination of a long campaign of disruption.

â according to the countryâs intelligence community, such interference is âdecade-long.â mounted by hacking groups believed to be linked to the fsb, successor to the kgb, and to russian military intelligence, it has involved methods such as âspearphishing, and campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organisations, and corporations,â the us intelligence agencies believe.

â in addition, the cia and fbi are now reportedly convinced that the hacking â and and the leaks published by wikileaks â were not merely aimed at generally disrupting the us electoral process, but specifically at damaging ms clinton, and helping the more sympathetic mr trump win. whether the meddling made a tangible difference however is hotly disputed, above all by mr trump, who has branded the charges âridiculous.â only this week he called for americans to âget on with our livesâ rather than pick a sanctions fight with moscow.

        the obama administration announced a round of sanctions against moscow on thursday over its alleged hacking into the democratic national committee's computers to influence this yearâs presidential election.

us intelligence agenciesâthe cia and fbiâhave previously accused russia of influencing november's election in order to help donald trump win the presidency, accusations russian president vladimir putin has vehemently denied. 



president obama signed an executive order thursday outlining the punishment for individuals and organizations they believe were involved in ""tampering with, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.""

the sanctions will hit russian individuals while closing two russian compounds, one in new york and another in maryland. thirty-five russian operatives and their families have been ordered to leave the country within the next 72 hours.



""these actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm us interests in violation of established international norms of behavior,"" the president said in a statement.

""russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in us democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the us government,"" his statement read. ""these actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.""

the president also hinted that this is merely the white houseâs public response to the alleged hacks and that it would retaliate outside of the public eye.

""these actions are not the sum total of our response to russiaâs aggressive activities,"" he continued. ""we will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized.""

breaking away from the current administration, president-elect donald trump saidâ that americans should be movingâ on with their lives.

""it's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,"" mr trump said in a statement. ""nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, i will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.""

over the course of his campaign, mr trump has promised better relations with mrâ putin while dismissing the us intelligence agencies who confirmed the cyber attacks. on wednesday, he told reporters that americans âout to get on with our livesâ rather than speculate over the impact russia had on this yearâs election.

however, house speaker paul ryan agreed with the obama administration on thursday by saying the sanctions were long overdue.

ârussia does not share america's interests. in fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world,â he said in a statement. âit serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left america weaker in the eyes of the world.â

issuing a statement of his own, senator john mccain said that russia is paying a small price for its ""brazen attack on us democracy.""

just an hour after the announcement, russian officials responded to the sanctions with a promise to retaliate.â 

âyou understand that responses will be cleaned and the american embassy in moscow, and, apparently, the consulate,â vladimir jabbarov, tass first deputy chairman of the federation council's international affairs committee, told reporters.

russiaâs uk embassy tweeted an image of a duck along with the word lame in response to the announcement saying everyone will be glad to see the âlast of this hapless administration.â

meanwhile, russian foreign ministry official konstantin dolgov called the sanctions futile and counterproductive.

âthe outgoing administration has no grounds, neither political nor moral rights for such harsh and destructive steps towards the bilateral relations with russia,â he told the interfax news agency. âi am sorry for the harsh wording but i don't have other words for it. this not just an agony of the 'lame ducks,' but of the 'political corpses.'â

        the obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to u.s. officials.

the administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. an announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week.

the sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the white house about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system.

the obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the united states' economic or national security.

the threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of china's president that his country would cease hacking u.s. companies' secrets to benefit chinese firms.

but officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant cyber-provocation in recent memory against the united states - russia's hacking of democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election.

four ways donald trump could be guilty of treason, law expert reveals



with the clock ticking, the white house is working on adapting the authority to punish the russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. president barack obama last week pledged there would be a response to moscow's interference in the u.s. elections.

one clear way to use the order against the russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the ""critical infrastructure"" of the united states. or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat - interfering in elections.

administration officials would also like to make it difficult for president-elect donald trump to roll back any action they take.

""part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,"" said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

obama issued the executive order in april 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets.

the order allows the government to freeze the assets in the united states of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened u.s. national security or financial stability. the sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country.

but just a year later, a russian military spy agency would hack into the democratic national committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on wikileaks, u.s. officials said. other releases followed, including the hacked emails of hillary clinton's campaign chairman, john podesta.

""fundamentally, it was a low-tech, high-impact event,"" said zachary goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at new york university school of law. and the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on wikileaks or seek to disrupt an election. ""it was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,"" he said.

so officials ""need to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the dnc hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,"" goldman said.

administration officials would like obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility.

""when the president came into office, he didn't have that many tools out there to use as a response"" to malicious cyber-acts, said ari schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the national security council. ""having the sanctions tool is really a big one. it can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the state department.""

the national security council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets.

""you would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the russians did actually harmed it,"" said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""those are two high bars.""

though russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state voter-registration database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said.

some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under ""government facilities,"" which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the department of homeland security.

another option is to use the executive order against other russian targets - say, hackers who stole commercial secrets - and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the united states considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure.

the idea is to not only punish but also deter.

""as much as i am concerned about what happened to us in the election, i am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,"" a second official said. ""i am firmly convinced that the russians and others will say, 'that worked pretty well in 2016, so let's keep going.' we have elections every two years in this country.""

even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. officials and experts point to the agreement chinese president xi jinping reached with obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction chinese companies.

complicating matters, the trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the white house on cyber issues, including the potential use of the cyber-sanctions order. the slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration's accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value.

sanctions are not a silver bullet. obama noted that ""we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the russians"" for their activities in ukraine. so it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the kremlin's behavior. but in combination with other measures, they could be effective.

criminal indictments of russians might become an option, officials said, but the fbi has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. at one point, federal prosecutors and fbi agents in san francisco considered indicting guccifer 2.0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown.

before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn russia. obama spoke to russian president vladimir putin at a group of 20 summit in china in september. about a week before the election, the united states sent a ""hotline""-style message to moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the state department's nuclear risk reduction center. as part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. it was the first use of that system. the russians, officials said, appeared to comply.

        in an interview released monday, president obama said that he would have beaten president-elect donald trump if heâd been allowed to run for a third term. 

""i am confident in this vision because i'm confident that if i, if i had run again and articulated it, i think i could've mobilized a majority of the american people to rally behind it,"" he told his longtime friend and adviser david axelrod on his podcast âthe axe files.â

later in the day, the president-elect took offense to the comment and responded on twitter. ""president obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,"" he tweeted. ""he should say that but i say no way! - jobs leaving, isis, ocare, etc.""

in the interview, obama also praised hillary clinton and restated his belief that she was mistreated during the campaign. however, he also critiqued the clinton campaign forâ what may have been its biggest weaknessâbelieving that a white house victory was all but certain.

        just weeks before he takes office, president-elect donald trump is urging the obama administration to veto the un resolution that would prevent israel from building settlements on palestinian territory.

""as the united states has long maintained, peace between the israelis and the palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the united nations,â trump said in a statement that he posted to facebook and twitter on thursday. âthis puts israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all israelis.""

of course, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has also condemned the resolution and has urged the united states to veto the proposal. the 15-member council will vote on the measure at 3pm et on thursday. itâs currently unclear whether or not the obama administration will vote in favor of the resolution.

in the past, president obama has criticized israelâs settlement construction in the west bank and east jerusalem but us officials told reuters this month that he is not expected to make major decisions between israeli-palestinian relations before he leaves office. while speaking at his final press conference of the year, the president urged trump to take on a fresh perspective of us foreign policy.

âwhat iâve advised the president-elect is that across the board on foreign policy, you wanna make sure that youâre doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way,â the president said last friday.

âand since thereâs only one president at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interaction with foreign governments, other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should wanna have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed on whatâs gone on in the past and where the potential pitfalls may be, where the opportunities are, what weâve learned from eight years of experience, so that as heâs then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, heâs got all the information to make good decisions.â

        donald trump cruised through the final vote of the electoral college, officially sealing his election win more than 270 votes.â 

as of now, mr trump has 304 of the 306 pledged electoral votes, as two faithless electors defected and cast their ballots for former representative ron paul and ohio gov john kasich.â 

the vote comes amid protests of mr trump's victory, as opponents urged the voters to break their pledge and cast their vote for another candidate. although the gathering of the electors is required by the constitution, they are not constitutionally required to adhere to their pledge that stems from the results of election night.â

however, the faithless electors did not show up in the numbers many believed or wished for. in fact, more electors voted against ms clinton than the two who decided against mr trump. the former secretary of state only earned 228 electoral votes of her pledged 232. in the process, ms clinton lost four electors in washington state â three of whom cast their votes for colin powell, and another for native american leader faith spotted eagle.â 

mr trump falsely touted the elector win as a ""historic electoral landslide"" in his statement on monday.â 

""today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy. i thank the american people for their overwhelming vote to elect me as their next president of the united states,"" he said, as he proceeded to take a jab at the political press. ""the official votes required to secure the presidency by a very large margin, far greater than ever anticipated by the media.""

mr trump's electoral college win is ranked 46th of the 58 elections in american history.â 

hundreds of protesters gathered at statehouses across the country where electors congregated to vote on monday afternoon.â

mr trump has raised the concerns of americans after his campaign galvanised white supremacist and neo-nazi movements â also known as the alt-right â across the country. his hiring of formerâ breitbartâ chair stephen bannon reaffirmed support from those groups.â 

still, many petitioned electors to reevaluate their pledges after news broke of russian efforts to sway the election in mr trump's favour.â 



  

donald trump completes victory tour by declaring 'we have tremendous hope'

us intelligence officials concluded the kremlin directed hacks of the democratic national committee and other officials, including clinton campaign chair john podesta.â 

""it is the assessment of the intelligence community that russia's goal here was to favour one candidate over the other, to help trump get elected,"" one official said. ""that's the consensus view.""

the trump transition team responded: ""these are the same people that said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction. the election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history. it's now time to move on and 'make america great again'.""

        in his final press conference of the year, president barack obama has said that he had told president vladimir putin to âcut it outâ following allegations that russia conducted cyber attacks against the united states. 

âwhat i was concerned about in particular was making sure [the hack of the democratic national convention] wasn't compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself,â the president said of his september meeting with his russian counterpart. 

he also said that his conversation prevented any further hacking against his countryâs election infrastructure. 

âso in early september when i saw president putin in china, i felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't. and in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election processâbut the leaks... had already occurred.""

mr obama declined to state explicitly that mr putin knew about the email hacking that tarnished the presidential election race, but left little doubt about who he thought was involved. he said that ânot much happens in russia without vladimir putinâ and repeated a us intelligence assessment âthat this happened at the highest levels of the russian government.â â in news revealed just as mr obama was speaking,cia director john brennan said in a message to employees that the fbi agrees with the cia's conclusion that russia's goal was to help donald trump win. mr trump himself has dismissed the cia's assessment and has called talk of russian hacking ""ridiculous"".â 

president obama has promised a âproportionalâ yet unspecified response to the hacking of the democratic party and hillary clinton's campaign chairman. emails stolen during the campaign were released in the final weeks by wikileaks. however, during his news conference on friday he went further, warning mr putin that the us would not shy away from using cyber methods of their own in retaliation. âwhatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them,â mr obama said.

mr obama expressed bewilderment about republican legislators and voters who now say they approve of mr putin. he he said unless that changes the u.s. will be vulnerable to foreign influence.â 

âronald reagan would roll over in his grave,â mr obama added.

the president said the news coverage around the hacking and the leaks that negatively affected hillary clintonâs presidential campaign was troubling - with the media carrying what he called an ""obsession"" with the flood of democratic emails that were made public during â the campaign -and that she was treated unfairly. he then addressed reports that there was âsquabblingâ between the white house and the upcoming trump administration over russiaâs apparent interference in novemberâs election.

""what we have simply said are the facts,"" he told reporters. ""based on uniform intelligence assessments, the russians were responsible for hacking the dnc, and as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure we are preventing that kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future.""

mr obama said his reticence to detail publicly the us response to russia reflected a need to retaliate âin a thoughtful, methodical way.ââ 

âthe idea that somehow public shaming is [going to] be effective, i think doesn't read the thought process in russia very well,â mr obama said. he said he wanted to give us intelligence officials more time to produce a report about the alleged hack that is due before he leaves office on 20 january and mr trump is sworn in as his successor.

however he was clear that reactions to the issue should not be split down party lines. ""that shouldn't be a partisan issue,"" mr obama said. ""my hope is the president-elect [mr trump] is similarly going to be concerned that we don't have foreign influence in our election process.""

the president rejected any notion that the dispute over the origin of the hacking was disrupting efforts to smoothly transfer power to mr trump. despite fiercely criticising each other during the election, mr obama and mr trump have spoken multiple times since the campaign ended.â 

âhe has listened,â mr obama said of mr trump. âi can't say he will end up implementing. but the conversations themselves have been cordial.ââ 

mr obama also addressed two other difficult foreign policy issues during his news conference - both of which will outlast his time in the white house.

mr obama warned about the economic and geopolitical consequences of any breakdown in the us-china relationship, and said mr trump should think carefully about the diplomatic repercussions if he decides to ""upend"" decades of us policy.

trump angered china earlier this month when he took a congratulatory phone call from taiwan's president, tsai ing-wen - the first call of its kind since 1979 when president jimmy carter acknowledged taiwan as part of ""one china.""

mr obama also condemned attacks on syrian civilians trying to flee the city of aleppo, blaming president bashar al-assad and his allies in russia and iran.

âthis blood and these atrocities are on their hands,â he said.â 

mrâ obama defended his decision to keep usâ troops out of syria and avoid military intervention, although he acknowledged the protracted anguish has weighed on him.

""everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,"" he said.

        the us election assistance commission, an agency who assists states to ensure that voting machines meet security standards, may have been hacked following the november election.

on thursday, the agency announced that the fbi is investigating the incident which was apparently blocked as soon as officials learned of the breach.

news of the potential hack follows reports of cybersecurity attacks in the us presidential election that have caused widespread concern across the states. however, theâ situation is unrelated to reports that russian hackers infiltrated the democratic national committee to help donald trump win the election earlier this year.

""we're hoping that his can be resolved relatively quickly,'' eac chairman tom hicks told usa today on friday, adding that the potential breach took place weeks after the election. ""we don't have any information about voters,'' he said. ""the states are running elections.''

congress created the eac back in 2002 coinciding with the help america vote act to ensure states would improve their voting systems and set standards for technical guidelines across the states.

security firm recorded future first identified the breach while monitoring underground markets where hackers buy and sell information. they recently discovered a russian-speaking hacker offering logon credentials for 100 people at they agency so buyers could access computers at the eac.

âwe donât think he actually works for any government or is super sophisticated,â andrei barysevich, director of advanced collection at recorded future, told reporters.

the fbi is currently investigating the incident but does not believe that a foreign government conducted the breach.

        police in washington have said they have issued a permit for the women's march on washington, a demonstration planned for the day after the inauguration of president-elect donald trump.â 

the metropolitan police department said it has issued a permit for the january 21 march to start near the us capitol. organisers have said they will march down independence avenue, and police said the march is scheduled to disperse at constitution avenue near the washington monument. but cassady fendlay, a spokeswoman for the march, said the route is not finalized, nor is the location where it will end.â 

police said that on their application, march organizers estimated 200,000 participants.

organisers initially hoped to rally at the lincoln memorial and other spaces, but those plans conflicted with other groups and inauguration events.â 

the washington post reported that janaye ingram, the head of logistics for the women's march on washington, said last week that the group still has a pending application for a permit for various locations that, like the lincoln memorial, are under the purview of the national park service. ingram said the group has not rescinded its application but is no longer interested in rallying in front of the lincoln memorial.â 

a national park service list of permit requests shows the group was also interested in space at the washington monument. about 20 groups have applied for permits to demonstrate on national park service land on or around the january 20 inauguration date.â 

national park service spokesman mike litterst said the agency is waiting for the presidential inaugural committee, which has priority, to make decisions about what space it will use before issuing permits for certain locations.

        republican electors are being swamped with pleas to buck tradition and cast ballots for someone else at meetings across the country on monday that are on course to ratify trump as the winner. interviews with more than 330 electors from both parties found little appetite for a revolt.â 

whether they like trump or not, and some plainly don't, scores of the republicans chosen to cast votes in the state-capital meetings told ap they feel bound by history, duty, party loyalty or the law to rubber-stamp their state's results and make him president. appeals numbering in the tens of thousands â drowning inboxes, ringing cellphones, stuffing home and office mailboxes with actual handwritten letters â have not swayed them.â

	trump has given electors strong grounds to reject him, say ethicists



the interviews found widespread democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the rush of anti-trump maneuvering can stop him. for that to happen, republican-appointed electors would have to stage an unprecedented defection.â 

still, people going to the typically ho-hum electoral gatherings have been drawn into the rough and tumble of campaign-season politics. republicans are being beseeched to revolt in a torrent of lobbying, centered on the arguments that clinton won the popular vote and that trump is unsuited to the presidency. most of it is falling on deaf ears, but it has also led to some acquaintances being made across the great political divide.â 

""let me give you the total as of right now: 48,324 emails about my role as an elector,"" said brian westrate, a small-business owner and gop district chairman in fall creek, wisconsin. ""i have a twitter debate with a former porn star from california asking me to change my vote. it's been fascinating.""â 

similarly deluged, republican elector hector maldonado, a missouri national guardsman, has taken the time to console one correspondent, a single mother and air force veteran who is beside herself with worry about what a trump presidency will mean.â 

""everything's going to be ok,"" he said he told her. ""i know you're scared, but don't worry. everything's going to be ok. and i know that it will be.""â 

maldonado, a mexican immigrant and medical-equipment seller in sullivan, missouri, backed ted cruz in the primaries but will cast his vote for trump with conviction. ""i took an oath once to become a u.s. citizen,"" he said, ""and on aug. 14, 1995, that was the first oath that i've taken to support the u.s. constitution. a year later i took the oath again, to support the duties of being an officer in the u.s. army. this was the third oath that i've taken to execute what i promised to do.""

electoral college members demand information on russian relations



even a leader of the anti-trump effort, bret chiafalo of everett, washington, calls it a ""losing bet"" â but one he says the republic's founders would want him to make. ""i believe that donald trump is a unique danger to our country and the founding fathers put the electoral college in place to, among other things, stop that from happening,"" said chiafalo, 38, an xbox network engineer who backed bernie sanders in the democratic primaries.â 

it takes 270 electoral votes to make a president. despite losing the national popular vote, trump won enough states to total 306 electoral votes. he would need to see three dozen fall away for him to lose his majority. only one republican elector told ap he won't vote for trump.â 

over the sweep of history, so-called faithless electors â those who vote for someone other than their state's popular-vote winner â have been exceptionally rare.â 

nashville attorney tom lawless, who chose marco rubio in the primaries, described his vow to cast his electoral vote for trump in blunt terms. ""hell will freeze and we will be skating on the lava before i change,"" he said. ""he won the state and i've pledged and gave my word that that's what i would do. and i won't break it.""â 

nor will jim skaggs, 78, a developer from bowling green, kentucky, despite deep concern about trump. ""his personality worries me,"" skaggs said. ""he is not open-minded."" skaggs knew trump's father through the construction business, met the son in his 20s, and ""i wasn't impressed.""â 

""i hope he is far better than i think he is,"" skaggs said. even so, ""i fully intend to vote for donald trump,"" he said. ""i think it's a duty.""â 

state law and practices vary for electors, but even in states where electors don't take an oath to vote a certain way or don't face legal ramifications for stepping out of line, the heavy expectation is for them to ratify the results. as much as they don't want trump in office, some democrats are as reluctant as republicans to go rogue.â 

""we lost the election,"" said john padilla of albuquerque, new mexico, a democratic ward chairman. ""that's how elections are and you shake hands with your opponent and you get on with what you have to do and support your candidate.""â 

yet democratic electors, stung by losing an election to a republican who trails clinton by more than 2.6 million votes nationwide, spoke strongly in the interviews in favor of overhauling or throwing out the electoral system. republican electors generally supported it, reasoning that it provides a counterweight to political dominance by coastal states with huge, and largely democratic, populations, like california and new york.â 

chiafalo is a co-founder of the hamilton electors, a group formed to steer other electors from both parties to a third candidate. ""we've stated from day 1 this is a long shot, this is a hail mary,"" he said.â 

but if the effort fails, it won't be from lack of trying. most of the pleas to reject trump are coordinated, automated, professionally generated and, for those reasons, none too persuasive.â 

""we got a stack of letters from idiots,"" said republican elector edward robson, 86, a phoenix, arizona, homebuilder.â 

fellow elector carole joyce, 72, a state committeewoman in phoenix and retired public health nurse, was more charitable.â 

""they've caused me great distress on my computer, that's for sure,"" she said. ""i average anywhere from a thousand to 3,000 emails a day. and i'm getting inundated in my regular mailbox out front â anywhere from 17 to 35 letters a day coming from washington state, oregon, all around the country. hand-written, some of them five or six pages long, quoting me the federalist papers, the constitution, asking me again out of desperation not to vote for donald trump.â

        in a move similar to the ""sh*t ton"" of celebrities gathered by filmmaker joss whedon for his save the day initiative, which urged voters to stop ""a racist, abusive coward who could permanently damage the fabric of our society"", celebrities are once more gathering together to push for urgent action.

unite for america is a multi-partisan movement founded by concerned citizens in an effort to ""prevent a candidate unfit for presidency from taking office"", urging the electoral college to follow through with itsâ own created purpose in preventing the election of a demagogue.â 

as martin sheen explains, the federalist papers state that the electorial college exists to ensure anyone who gains presidency is, ""to an eminent degree, endowed with the requisite qualifications"".â

trump threat: 'political reprisal' against his own party members



the electoral college consists of 538 members who will convene on monday to vote for the next president; with trump gaining the necessary 270 votes to win with a total of 306, requiring 37 gop electors to switch their votes to delay his official election.â 

therefore, the video urges gop electors to vote for any candidate they deem ""especially competent"" for the position, not specifically to switch their vote to hillary clinton. those involved state that trump clearly lacks the necessary ""qualifications"", ""stability"", and ""clearly the respect for the constitution of our great nation"".â

there have been 157 instances of faithless electors - those who do not vote for the candidate pledged - so far, though none have yet to affect the ultimate outcome of an election.

a harvard law professor claims that between 20-30 gop electors are ready to break their pledge, though hopefully this move will be maintained under reported threats from the trump campaign that there will be ""political reprisal"" if they rebel against him.

        donald trump has reportedly threatened members of his own republican party with ""political reprisal"" if they rebel and refuse to vote him in as president.â 

""the donald trump campaign is putting pressure on republican electors to vote for him based on future political outcomes,"" an anonymous member of the us electoral college told salon.â 

electors are voted in by people in their stateâ who are supporting the candidate they want to become president. this process is called the ""electoral college"".

there are 538 members and they are expected to vote in line with the majority of voters in their state. throughout history more than 99 per cent of electorsâ have done so, according to usâ government figures.â 



  

harvard law professor says '30' gop electors ready to block trump win

but a group dubbing themselves the ""hamilton electors""â are urging themâ to ignore their mandates and vote for aâ candidate other than mr trump. it is thoughtâ john kasich, the ohio governor who has twice made unsuccessful bids for the presidency might be considered as an alternative.â 

to date, eight ""faithless electors""â have come forward andâ saidâ they will vote against their nominee for an alternative candidate. however, only one was from mr trump'sâ republican party.â 

â 

the other seven are democrats, casting their votes elsewhere as a form of protest.

""electors of conscience can still do the right thing for the good of the country,"" said the lone republican dissenter christopher suprun, as the former firefighter and 9/11 responder announced his intention to rebel in the new york times.

mr suprun suggested that several other electors were mulling a rebellion, and harvard law professor and former democratic electorâ larry lessig has claimed that ""at least 20"" are willing to cast their votes elsewhere.

the threats reportedly being issued by the trump camp are therefore likely intended to head off any remote possibility of a late shock.

other republican electors have stepped down in protest, or been forced to resign after declaring their intention to vote against the president-elect.

the hamilton electors need to win the support of 37 republican electors to deny trump the 270 votes he needs to secure the presidency.

if that happens by the time votes are cast on monday 19 december, the election will be decided by the house of representatives. it's happened twice before â but not since 1824.

the breakaway group is named in honour of founding father alexander hamilton, who wrote that electors had to ensure âthat the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.â

        ten members of the electoral college have requested more information from intelligence officials on the relationship between president-elect donald trump and russia.

the electoral college addressed an open letter to director of national intelligence james clapper prior to their 19 december vote that would finalise the election results.â 

us intelligence officials concluded that russia conducted hacks against the democratic national committee and other associated officials in order to help mr trump win the election. president barack obama had earlier called for a ""full review""â of intelligence surrounding russia's involvement in the hacks.

the electors have called for the release of information ""to investigate, discuss, and deliberate with our colleagues about whom to vote for in the electoral college"".

""the electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between donald trump, his campaign or associates, and russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,"" they wrote in an open letter to director of national intelligence james clapper.

""we further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether mr trump is fit to serve as president of the united states.""

the electors said they found the trump transition team's dismissal of the findings of the cia concerning, and outlined concerns about trump associates who are linked to the hacks of the democratic national committee.â 

the clinton campaign came out in support of the electors' push to have an intelligence briefing in the next week.â 

""the bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,""â clinton campaign chair john podesta said. ""electors have a solemn responsibility under the constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed.""

""each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid donald trump,""â he added. ""despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign.

""we now know that the cia has determined russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing donald trump. this should distress every american.""

mr trump and his team have repeatedly written off the intelligence official's reported findings.â

""these are the same people that said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction,â the team incorrectly said in a perplexing statement. ""the election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history. it's now time to move on and 'make america great again'.""

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters that congress will launch a probe into the cia assessment, and broke with mr trump on his support for the us intelligence.

""obvisouly any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and i strongly condemn any such efforts,"" he said.â 

news of the probe comes after republican sen john mccain and democratic sen chuck schumer issued a statement calling for a bipartisan investigation into the reports.

""when a foreign power tries to influence our election or damage our economy, for that matter, this is serious,"" mr schumer told cbs. ""and a bipartisan investigation that's not aimed at one specific instance but looks at the broad scope of this is just what's needed.""

        president barack obama hasâ ordered a ""full review"" of election-related hacking that many believe affected the outcome of the 2016 election.â 

""we may have crossed into a new threshold and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,"" said lisa monaco, mr obama's counterterrorism and homeland security adviser.

the announcement comes amid calls for the recounts from activists and computing experts, who allege anomalies in voting results in crucial states that led to a trump win.â

mr obama expects the full report before he leaves office on 20 january. althoughâ ms monaco said the report would be shared with members of congress, it was not clear that the findings would be made public.â 

warning of the dangers of national security threats that come from the internet, ms monaco said the new administration will ""inherit a rapidly growing threat in this space across all dimensions"".â 

california representative adam schiff, a senior-ranking member of the house intelligence committee, applauded the obama administration's announcement, and called for the president to declassify as much of the findings as possible.



  

trump 'accused of treason' after urging russia to hack hillary clinton's email

""it is clear that the russians hacked our democratic institutions and sought to interfere in our elections and sow dischord. in this, tragically, they succeeded,"" he said. ""given president-elect trump's disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before president obama leaves office next month.""

president-elect donald trumpâ has remained sceptical of the intelligence community's findings. he denied their claims that the election had been tampered with in an interview with time magazine, which named him theirâ person of the yearâ this week.â 

""i don't believe it. i don't believe they interfered,"" mr trump said, confirming that he thought the conclusions reached by the obama-appointed officials were politically driven.

leading statisticians call for us vote audit over hacking fears



in october, the department of homeland security and the office of the director of national intelligence officially accused russia of hacking the democratic national committee and other political organisations ""intended to interfere with the us election process"".

intelligence officials reiterated their accusation earlier this week.â 

""the us intelligence community is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from us persons and institutions, including from usâ political organisations,"" officials said in a statement to nbc. ""we believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only russia's senior-most officials could have authorised these activities.""

shortly after the election, two prominent us statisticians called for a recount to rule out the possibility that the outcome was manipulated by outside actors â especially in crucial swing states that ultimately went to mr trump.â 

""the national results could be tipped by manipulating the vote count in a relatively small number of jurisdictions â a few dozen spread across a few key states,"" said mit cryptographer ron rivest and berkeley statistician philip stark in an editorial published in usa today.

""we know that the vast majority of local elections officials have limited resources to detect or defend against cyber attacks,"" the added, claiming that ""various aspects of the preliminary results, such as a high rate of undervotes"" for mr trump ""have aroused suspicion"".

        donald trump will keep his executive producer credit on nbcâs celebrity apprentice throughout his presidency.

trump is the original star of the television series that will kick off its 15th season new host arnold schwarzenegger on january 2. in the showâs final credit sequence, trumpâs name will air following the showâs creator mark burnett, who distanced himself from the republicanâs presidential campaign last year. then, he condemned the âhatred, division, and misogynyâ of trump's presidential platform.

following his derogatory comments toward mexican immigrants last year, nbc universal distanced themselves from trump, saying they would only air celebrity apprentice because he was completely removed from the series. robert greenblatt, the companyâs chairman, also promised that trump âwould neverâ return to celebrity apprentice as long as heâs with the company. 

it's currently unclear if greenblatt is leaving the company.

on thursday, not only did people criticize yet another conflict of interest for the business mogul turned president-elect, but disavowed nbc, a company who owns a major news network, for having a financial stake in a series with the next president.


trump staying involved with #theapprentice makes the fact that nbc executives are avoiding the press in january even more cowardly and gross

        madonna, the pop icon and high-profile hillary clinton supporter, is criticizing women who voted for donald trump and offering her thoughts on what lies ahead for the country in the weeks following the presidential election.

""[the election] felt like someone died,"" she told billboard in an interview publishedâ monday. ""[it] felt like a combination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death. i feel that way every morning; i wake up and say, 'oh, wait, donald trump is still the president,' and it wasnât a bad dream that i had."" 

the publication recently named madonna their âwoman of the yearâ admitted that she felt betrayed by female voters who cast their ballot for trump, who has been accused of committing dozens of incidents of sexual assault.

""it feels like women betrayed us,"" she continued. ""the percentage of women who voted for trump was insanely high. women's nature is not to support other women. it's really sad. men protect each other, and women protect their men and children. women turn inward and men are more external.

""a lot of it has do with jealousy and some sort of tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation,"" she explained. ""other people just didn't bother to vote because they didn't like either candidate, or they didn't think trump had a chance in the world. they took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.""

madonna also shared the story behind the first time she met the 70-year-old president-elect at his mar-a-lago estate in palm beach, florida some odd years ago.

""he's a very friendly guy, â­charismatic in that â­boastful, macho, alpha-male way,"" she told the publication. ""i found his political incorrectness amusing. of course, i didn't know he was going to be running for â­president 20 years later. people like that exist in the world, i'm ok with it. they just canât be heads of state. i just can't put him and barack obama in the same â­sentence, same room, same job description.â

on theâ eve of the election, she held an impromptu concert at washington square park urging new yorkers to vote for clinton. earlier in the year, she also jokingly offered oral sex to anyone willing to cast their vote for the former secretary of state.

while speaking to billboard, she also touched on misogyny and ageism in the entertainment industry. ""'relevance' is a catchphrase that people throw out because we live in a world full of discrimination,"" she continued. ""age is only brought up with regard to women. it's connected to sexism, chauvinism, and misogyny. when leonardo [dicaprio] is 60 years old, no one is going to talk about his relevance. am i relevant as a female in this society that hates women? well, to people who are educated and are not chauvinists or â­misogynists, yes.""

        while president-elect donald trump continues to incorrectly insist that massive voter fraud occurred on election day â causing hillary clinton to win the popular vote â even his own attorneys cannot agree with his theories.

in fillings to block green party candidate jill steinâs recount initiative, lawyers for the trump campaign confirmed that they found no evidence of discrepancies in how the votes were counted.â 

late last month, dr stein launched a fundraiser to file for recounts in key states, including michigan, pennsylvania, and wisconsin â all crucial factors in hillary clintonâs loss.â

but the trump team accused her of attempting disenfranchisement in a filing against the recount in a michigan court, according to the washington post.

âon what basis does stein seek to disenfranchise michigan citizens? none really, save for speculation,â they wrote. âall available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.â

in their filing against the pennsylvania recount, mr trumpâs lawyers dismiss dr steinâs accusations, but are not quite as absolute in their statement.â 

âon what basis does stein seek to disenfranchise the voters of the keystone state? none, really,â it says. âthere is no evidence â or even any allegation â that any tampering with pennsylvaniaâs voting systems actually occurred.â

shortly after thanksgiving, mr trump alleged that millions of illegal votes were cast against him, and provided more evidence. he also called him win a âlandslideâ despite the fact that ms clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.5 million votes.

âin addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,â he tweeted.â 

the president-elect continued: âserious voter fraud in virginia, new hampshire, and california â so why isnât the media reporting on this? serious problem â big problem!ââ

former chair of the republican national committee and incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus told cbs that it was certainly âpossibleâ that millions of undocumented immigrants voted for ms clinton. still, like his new boss, he cited no evidence in support of the claim.â 

similarly, the highest ranking republican official, house speaker paul ryan did not repudiate mr trumpâs false allegation. when asked about mr trumpâs tweet, he simply told 60 minutes he did not know if the claim had weight. he said he was ânot really focused on these thingsâ.

        president-elect donald trump has chosen retired marine gen. james n. mattis to be secretary of defense, according to people familiar with the decision, nominating a former senior military officer who led operations across the middle east to run the pentagon less than four years after he hung up his uniform.

to take the job, mattis will need congress to pass new legislation to bypass a federal law stating that defense secretaries must not have been on active duty in the previous seven years. congress has granted a similar exception just once, when gen. george c. marshall was appointed to the job in 1950.

an announcement is likely by early next week, according to the people familiar with the choice. jason miller, a spokesman with the trump transition team, tweeted thursday evening that no decision had been made. trumpâs son donald jr., meanwhile, retweeted a report saying that mattis got the job.

mattis, 66, retired as the chief of u.s. central command in spring 2013 after serving more than four decades in the marine corps. he is known as one of the most influential military leaders of his generation, serving as a strategic thinker while occasionally drawing rebukes for his aggressive talk. since retiring, he has served as a consultant and as a visiting fellow with the hoover institution, a think tank at stanford university.

like trump, mattis favors a tougher stance against u.s. adversaries abroad, especially iran. the general, speaking at the center for strategic and international studies in april, said that while security discussions often focus on terrorist groups such as the islamic state or al-qaeda, the iranian regime is âthe single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the middle east.â

mattis said the next president âis going to inherit a messâ and argued that the nuclear deal signed by the obama administration last year may slow iranâs ambitions to get a nuclear weapon but will not stop them.

âin terms of strengthening americaâs global standing among european and mideastern nations alike, the sense is that america has become somewhat irrelevant in the middle east, and we certainly have the least influence in 40 years,â mattis said.

but mattis may break with trumpâs practice of calling out allies for not doing enough to build stability. in the same event, mattis said he was troubled by president obamaâs remarks in a march interview with the atlantic that there were âfree ridersâ accepting u.s. help without reciprocating. he added that he read the atlantic story after printing it out and briefly thought he had accidentally mixed it with a news clip that highlighted trumpâs views.

âthe president-elect is smart to think about putting someone as respected as jim mattis in this role,â said a former senior pentagon official. âheâs a warrior, scholar and straight shooter â literally and figuratively. he speaks truth to everyone and would certainly speak truth to this new commander in chief.â

but the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss trumpâs personnel choices, said: âif thereâs any concern at all, itâs the principle of civilian control over the military. this role was never intended to be a kind of joint chiefs of staff on steroids, and thatâs the biggest single risk tied to mattis. for mattis, the biggest risk for him personally is that he will have a national security adviser in the form of mike flynn whose management style and extreme views may arch mattisâs eyebrows and cause conflict over time. itâs no fun to be secretary of defense if you have to constantly feud with the white house.â

mattis served from november 2007 to august 2010 as the supreme allied commander of transformation for the north atlantic treaty organization, focused on improving the military effectiveness of allies. trump called nato âobsoleteâ earlier this year before saying later that he was âall for natoâ but wanted all members to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, a nato goal.

mattis would join the trump administration after calls by some conservatives for him to join the presidential race in a long-shot independent bid aimed at derailing trumpâs ascent this spring. the general declined to do so, saying he did not understand the speculation.

mattis, whose nicknames include âmad dogâ and the âwarrior monk,â has had a leading hand in some of the u.s. militaryâs most significant operations in the past 20 years. as a one-star general, he led an amphibious task force of marines that carried out a november 2001 raid in helicopters on afghanistanâs kandahar province, giving the pentagon a new foothold against the taliban after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. using the call sign âchaos,â he commanded a division of marines during the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003 and returned there the following year to lead marines in bloody street fighting in the city of fallujah.

mattis continued to rise through the ranks and establish his credentials as a military thinker, co-authoring the u.s. militaryâs new counterinsurgency manual with then-army lt. gen. david h. petraeus while mattis was a three-star general at quantico, va.

he was considered a leading contender to become commandant of the marine corps in 2010 but was bypassed in favor of gen. james f. amos. instead, mattis replaced petraeus as the chief of central command, overseeing u.s. military operations across the middle east.

even though central command did not encompass israel, mattis made a concerted effort to reach out to his israeli military counterparts, according to steven simon, who worked with mattis when he served on obamaâs national security council.

simon, who now teaches at amherst college, said mattis made frequent stops in israel during trips to the region, part of an effort to encourage the jewish state and its arab neighbors to work together to counter iranian influence. âthey respected mattis because they saw him as a straight shooter and a good listener,â simon said of the israelis and arabs.

the general retired from that position in 2013 about five months earlier than expected, prompting speculation that he was forced out after clashing with some in the obama administration on iran policy. u.s. officials denied that was the case at the time, and mattis declined to comment.

mattis occasionally has come under scrutiny for impolitic remarks. most notably, he said in 2005 during a panel discussion in san diego that âitâs fun to shoot some peopleâ and âi like brawling,â drawing criticism from the marine commandant at the time, gen. michael hagee. but hagee also later backed mattis, saying the general often spoke with candor to reflect the horrors of war. other supporters noted that he often stressed to his troops that it was important to treat civilians in a combat zone with care.

it is unclear whether the legislation required to make mattis the pentagon chief will be difficult to obtain from congress. the 1947 national security law said that a general must wait 10 years from leaving active duty before becoming defense secretary. an exception was granted on a one-time basis for marshall, with lawmakers saying in special legislation at the time that it was the âsense of the congress that after general marshall leaves the office of secretary of defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.â

the 10-year period was reduced to seven years in 2008 for several senior civilian defense positions, including defense secretary.

        president-elect donald trump held what appeared to be more of a campaign rally during his transition as he launched his âthank youâ tour in ohio.â 

although mr trump has remained in the news by sending out early morning tweets falsely claiming he won the election in a landslide if not for three million illegal votes, falsely claiming to have saved jobs in kentucky, or falsely accusing the press of dishonesty, he has been otherwise elusive since winning the election.â

trump says companies leaving us will face 'consequences'



the president-elect returned to form thursday night on cincinatti, where he spoke before a stadium with far more empty seats than his previous appearance in the venue in october. granted, there were still a fair amount of attendees to see the unlikely head of state revelâ in victory.

âwe had a lot of fun fighting hillary clinton,â he said to the crowd. it was a moment of call and response, as the audience chanted âlock her upâ.â 

mr trump broke from his script numerous times, glorifying his win. in the case of ohio, a state he claimed to have won by 10 points, he inflated the numbers by two.â 

âhow about north carolina â how well did we do in north carolina? remember when they said âhe cannot win north carolinaâ?â mr trump said, rebuking the âdishonest pressâ. the crowd booed when he pointed to the press pool in the back of the arena. âdonald trump canât break the blue wall, right? we didnât break it, we shattered that sucker.â

âwe shattered it, man. that poor wall is busted up.â

he also took the opportunity to confirmed that he had chosen retired marine gen james mattis as secretary of defence â a break from his spokesperson, jason miller, who denied earlier reports from the washington post and cnn.â 

âwe are going to appoint âmad dogâ mattis as our secretary of defence,â he said after a lengthy preamble about how he did not want to tell the audience. âbut weâre not announcing it until monday, so donât tell anybody.â

in his return to the teleprompter, mr trump attempted to denounce the wave of hundreds of reported hate crimes that spiked since his election. claiming to represent inclusivity with hopes to unite the nation, he condemned âbigotry and hatred in all its formsâ. he did not specifically speak out against the white supremacist and neo-nazi groups who have openly celebrated his victory and appointment of stephen bannon as chief strategist, however.â 

still, he repeated alienating promises to bar refugees from the middle east. he blamed the monday knife attack at the ohio state campus on lax refugee policies âcreated by our very, very stupid politiciansâ.

âpeople are pouring in from regions of the middle east,â he falsely insisted, skirting the fact that the osu attacker immigrated from somalia when he was a child. âwe have no idea who they are, where they come from, what theyâre thinking and weâre going to stop that dead, cold flat.â

mr trumpâs return to the stump is unprecedented in us politics. presidents-elect do not generally return to the trail to deliver their promises while they are supposed to be filling critical cabinet positions. the move is especially unusual given reports of mr trumpâs rejection of intelligence briefings.

earlier on thursday, mr trump took a âvictory lapâ in indiana for a deal reached with the carrier heating and air-conditioning company. in the agreement reached with carrier and their parent company, united technologies,800 factory, as well as 300 research and technology jobs, will remain in indiana rather than going to mexico.

still, despite mr trumpâs boast of saving almost 1,000 jobs in the us, some 1,300 jobs will be outsourced. the wall street journal reported that 600 jobs from the indianapolis plant are still expected to move to mexico. while a united technology factory in huntington, indiana, will close and send 700 jobs to mexico.â 

in his speech celebrating that deal, mr trump warned companies that outsourced jobs during his presidency.â 

âcompanies are not going to leave the united states anymore without consequences,â he said. âitâs simply not going to happen.â

mr trump did not disclose whether he would penalise carrier and united technologies come january.

        donald trump has announced he is leaving his ""great"" business empire âin totalâ ahead of taking the reins as americaâs 45th president.

the move is a direct effort to address concerns his extensive business and property holdings present conflicts of interest that could influence decision making.

mr trump took to twitter to announce the decision to his 16 million followers, and delivered the news in the form of a cliff-hanger, saying he would be âleaving myâ¦â

        donald trump is expected to name a man with ties to wall street and no government experience to the post of treasury secretary.â 

steven terner mnuchin, 53, is an ex-banker for goldman sachs who has spent recent years as a hollywood producer. he joined the trump campaign as finance chairman in may.

mr trump campaigned repeatedly accused his opponent hillary clinton of being in the pocket of wall street executives who ârobbedâ working class americans. and the appointment of mr mnuchin â who spent years as a goldman chief executive â signifies yet another shift from the president-electâs major campaign promises.â 

in fact, in 2009, mr mnuchin benefitted directly from the housing meltdown. he led the group that bought indymac, a lender that offered high risk subprime loans, for an incredibly low price, according to cnn.

as chairman of the company, now called onewest, mr mnuchin sold it to the small business lender in 2015 for twice the price paid.â 

mr mnuchin â who bankrolled such movies as mad max: fury road, suicide squad, the lego movie, and american sniper â would help carry out many of mr trumpâs economic policies, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. but he would also manage federal government debt, oversee banking regulations, and the internal revenue service.

he joined goldman sachs when he was 22, where he served as a partner until leaving 17 years later in 2002. for a brief period of time, he worked for liberal financier george soros. he then started his own hedge fund, dune capital management in 2004.â 

according to bloomberg, close friends of mr mnuchin found his position in the trump campaign as a bit of a shock.â

        donald trump will once more feel the love that unexpectedly propelled him to victory over hillary clinton three weeks ago with a so-called âthank you tourâ of public appearances starting with a giant rally in cincinnati, ohio, on thursday night.

while there is so far no published tour schedule, the director of mr trumpâs advance planning team, george gigicos, has said that that the president-elect will be traveling âobviously to the states that we won and the swing states we flipped overâ.â

john oliver's warning about donald trump's presidency becoming normal



while some will see it as mr trump looking to indulge in a victory lap around the country, mr gigicos insisted that it was about giving thanks to those voters who helped him on his way to his electoral college victory on 8 november, against the expectations of nearly all the main polling organisations and of the clinton campaign as well.

however you choose to characterise it, the tour will only compound the feeling among some that the election campaign isnât really over, at least in the mind of mr trump who still hasnât foregone his habit of airing his every passing thought - and grievance - via the medium of twitter.

that sense has also been kept alive by the lingering squabble over recounts petitioned for by green party leader jill stein in three states where his margin of victory was tiny - wisconsin, pennsylvania and michigan - and mr trumpâs subsequently claim that he would have won the popular but for alleged fraud in three other states, california, virginia and new hampshire. â 

thursday nightâs event is planned for the gaping us bank arena in downtown cincinnati in western ohio, another midwestern state that helped put mr trump over the top.

the decision to launch the tour is also an expression of mr trumpâs belief it was his succession of boisterous rallies that first won him the republican nomination last summer and then took him all the way to victory on election day. he was often faulted by political hands who argued he was putting all his energy into the rallies at the expense of paying attention to more nuts-and-bolts requirements of a campaign, like the get-out-the-vote effort at the grassroots level.â 

how he pitches his message to his supporters will be closely watched. any return to his familiar campaigning form, when he mixed a nationalist populist message with grievances about the âriggedâ establishment ranged against him, will dismay those in the republican party who have been grasping at any signs of a moderation of tone since he has become president-elect.â 

any suggestion that the tour is meant to rub salt into the wounds sustained by democrats and those who had hoped for a clinton victory will also deepen anxiety that mr trumpâs words about unifying the country after one of those bilious campaigns in modern history will prove empty.

certainly it is an unusual project. mr trump already has a full plate completing his choices for his cabinet and other top positions in washington and keeping his transition from descending into chaos, as it has already threatened to in recent days, not least the tug of war that has erupted over his courtship of mitt romney as a possible secretary of state.

and even if mr trump believes he can spare the time to return to the hustings even though the election is over, it is unclear who would be paying the costs of renting spaces as large as the us bank arena and covering all the other associated costs of major rallies.

clearly, the tour will not be paying visits to those states that remained unflinchingly blue, like new york or california. but other states in the heartland that could be identified for future stops are likely to include wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania, notwithstanding any recounts that could conceivably challenge his narrow victories in each of them.â 

he is expected also to bring vice president-elect mike pence, who is currently running the transition effort, along to the cincinnati event.â

        democrats on capitol hill are bracing for turbulence on wednesday when they must decide in a secret ballot whether to dump nancy pelosi of california as their leader and seek fresh blood.â 

it will be a fateful moment for a party that has barely begun its post mortem on a deeply disastrous showing in the 8 november elections. hillary clinton failed in her bid for the presidency and predictions of big gains in both chambers of congress were dashed also.

trump ally says clinton increases prosecution risk asking for recount



a challenge to ms pelosi, who has led the democrats in the house of representatives for almost 14 years, part of the time serving as speaker, has come in the somewhat unlikely form of tim ryan. a 43-year-old former high school football star with a low profile in washington until now, he has represented his district around youngstown in eastern ohio since 2003. â 

but mr ryan has engaged in an increasingly vicious contests withâ ms pelosi makingâ the argument that under her leadership the party has forgotten how to pitch an economic message to voters like those in his rust-belt district - that means mostly white, working-class americans -â while becoming too beholden to special interests and focused on americaâs culture wars.â 

he has also vowed to reverse the perception that the democrats have become a party of coastal elites with almost no relevance to the american heartland, including to blue-collar workers who helped deliver the presidential contest to mr trump often in midwestern states that had been expected to vote democrat like michigan and wisconsin.

offering aâ reset for the party, he has argued the time has arrived to, âget rid of the perception that weâre tied to wall street, that weâre coastal elites and that weâre more concerned with the donor class than the working class"".

represenative tim ryan, ohio, addresses the democratic national convention in july (ap)

it would also be a generation re-boot. mr ryanâs bid to topple ms pelosi remains a very long shot but he is also hoping that his colleagues share his view that the party needs an injection of youth at the top.â 

it does not seem an unreasonable position. ms pelosi will be 77 next year. and nor are her main lieutenants at the top of the partyâs power structure exactly fresh out of the nursery. steny hoyer, her deputy, will be 78 and jim clyburn, the no. 3 democrat in the house, will be 77.

conscious of complaints that she and her inner circle have commanded too much power and influence - and are indeed septuagenarians - ms pelosi has vowed to reserve some positions near the top of the hierarchy for representatives who have only been in congress for less than five, two-year terms. â that, however, has met resistance from black members who say it would unfairly bar some of their caucus from taking those positions.

she furiously rejected claims from mr ryan that even these proposed changes were in fact desigend to consolidate her power at the top of the party. âitâs so completely not true that itâs almost pathetic,â she told the huffington post on monday. â âyou know, itâs just notâ itâs not what it is.â â she also ridiculed him for failing to carry his own district for hillary clinton on 8 november.â 



she has resisted calls from mr ryan to change the rules so that head of the democratic congressional campaign committee - the body that essentially sets strategy for each election cycle to try to regain ground on the republicans - should be elected to the position and not appointed by the party leadership as is the case now.â 

âwe must continue our efforts to decentralize the power in caucus so every member is a part of the team and plays a role in shaping our future,â mr ryan said in a statement monday afternoon, in reference to that resistance. he has won some public support from a small smattering of colleagues but for now is hoping that many more will vote for him with the protection of the secret ballot.â 

part of his pitch is that coastal democrats like ms pelosi, whose district is in california, cannot connect with the voters lost to the party in the heartland.

âwe have got to have the right messenger,â he said recently. âwe have got to have someone who cannot just go on msnbc, but go on fox and fox business and cnbc and go into union halls and fish fries and churches all over the country and start a brush fire about what a new democratic party looks like.â

if the party eventually spurns him, as is likely, it will in part be because of sheer loyalty to ms pelosi, who has been a dominating figure for well over a decade. she is also a formidable fund-raiser and money, in the end, matters to anyone who must face re-election every two years.

among those publicly to have endorsed ms pelosi over mr ryan has been president barack obama who last week lauded her as âa remarkable leaderâ of âextraordinary political skillâ.

to mr ryanâs advantage is the reality of the failure of ms pelosi to steer the party to success in november. while she had predicted that democrats would achieve a net gain of about 25 seats on election day, the number is likely to settle at just six (a small number of districts where the results were very close are still counting and verifying votes).

        the chaos - and sheer bewilderment - within hillary clintonâs camp on election night was on public display. even as losses in vital states such as michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania trickled in, the campaign refused to admit defeat.

âtheyâre still counting votes and every vote should count. several states are too close to call, so weâre not gonna have anything more to say tonight,â campaign chairman john podesta told supporters. yet shortly afterwards, ms clinton called her rival donald trump to concede.

the trigger for that move, according to a new report, was a call to ms clinton from president barack obama. âyou need to concede,â mr obama told his former secretary of state.



shortly afterwards, sitting in a room at the peninsula hotel in new york, she picked picked up the phone to call the man with whom she had been engaged inâ probably the ugliest presidential fight in modern us history.

the details are contained forthcoming book on ms clintonâs defeat and revealed on monday by the hill. the book by amie parnes and jonathan allen, cites three sources from the clinton camp who were familiar with the way the election night defeat played out.

the report said that mr obamaâs call left a bad taste in the mouths of some ms clintonâs supporters, who thought she should have clung on.

âthere was a lot of discussion about michigan and wisconsin and whether the numbers could flip it,â said one of the sources.â 

yet after receiving mr obamaâs call, ms clinton decided to take the momentous decision to aknowledge the loss, and call mr trump.

âjust give me the phone,â she reportedly said. âiâm calling him.â

there was apparently also disagreement between ms clintonâs camp and the white house on whether to support a ballot recount effort launched by green party leader jill stein.

on saturday, ms clintonâs campaign confirmed that it was supporting the effort to recount some votes in michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania.

ms stein officially filed a recount request in wisconsin on friday afternoon, and her campaign has said she hopes to also push through recounts in michigan and pennsylvania. the wisconsin elections commission said it has a december 13 deadline to complete the recount of more than 2.9mâ votes.

writing on medium, the clinton campaignâs chief legal advisor, marc elias, said a decision had been taken to participate even though it had found no evidence itself of any hacking of the voting systems in any of the states, as some have suggested.â 

âbecause we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,â he wrote.

mr trump has denounced the recount effort and accused ms clinton, who beat him in the popular vote by more than two million votes, of hypocrisy. early on sunday, he took to twitter, to repeat his condemnation of the move.

later, mr trump said - without providing any evidence - that he would have won the popular vote as well, but for the âmillions of people had voted illegally in the electionâ.

        donald trump has blasted the recount effort launched last week by the green party in wisconsin which on saturday attracted the formal support also of hillary clinton.

from his palm beach retreat in florida, mr trump issued a lengthy rebuke of the initiative calling it âridiculousâ and a âscamâ that had been launched purely to benefit the green partyâs nominee, jill stein, and âfill her coffers with moneyâ.

so far ms stein has raised close to $6 million through crowdfunding to pay to petition for recounts of the election results in three states. the request for a recount was submitted to the election authorities in wisconsin on friday. if she reaches her goal of raising $7 million in total she will be able to make similar filings to pennsylvania and michigan next week.â

trump is dishonest, but he doesn't mean we are in a 'post-truth' era



âthis recount is just a way for jill stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasnât even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,â mr trump railed. âall three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes.â

in pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral college votes, mr trump in fact won by roughly 68,000 votes, and in wisconsin, which has ten such votes, his margin was even smaller: just 27,000. michigan, which carries 14 votes, is still too close to call, with the difference between the two candidates amounting to fewer than 12,000.

on saturday, the clinton campaign revealed in a posting on medium, the online publishing platform, that although it has found no evidence of any external manipulation or tampering of voting systems in any of the states, it will participate in the process that the green party started.

the development appeared to get under the skin of mr trump, though most of his ire was focused on ms stein. âthis is a scam by the green party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what jill stein is doing,â he said.

however, the statement opened with an implied charge of hypocrisy on the part ms clinton also. âthe people have spoken and the election is over, and as hillary clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, 'we must accept this result and then look to the future.ââ

there is some irony to the situation, given how often ms clinton and her allies admonished mr trump before election day to respect the results when they came in. he had repeatedly called the system rigged and ms clinton was certain that she would be the victor on 8 november.â

'strong evidence' election was rigged against clinton in 3 key states



âwe have assembled an internal team to direct the recount, we have been in close consultation with our county clerk partners, and have arranged for legal representation by the wisconsin department of justice.â

mr haas said he would hold a teleconference meeting with county clerks in the coming days and expected that the recount would begin late next week, after ms stein's campaign submitted the necessary recount fee, which was still being calculated.

ms stein has raised more than $4.7m from a grassroots crowdfunding effort to pay for a manual recount of ballots in wisconsin, pennsylvania and michigan amid claims from computer experts and electoral lawyers that the vote totals in those states could have been manipulated.

all three states, which democratic nominee hillary clinton had been expecting to win, were instead claimed by mr trump. while no specific evidence of fraud or irregularity has been cited, the presidential campaign was thrown off track more than once by reported hacks into voter and party databases.

prominent cybersecurity experts have recently said that although the chances of the election results being tampered with were slim, a recount would be the best way to ensure that results are valid.

âlet me be very clear: we do not have evidence of fraud. we do not have smoking guns. what we do have is an election that was surrounded by hacking,â ms stein wrote on her campaign website.

after filing for a recount in wisconsin, and having raised sufficient funds for a similar petition in pennsylvania, to be filed by monday, âwe will focus on raising the needed funds for michigan's recount (due wednesday),â she added.

in pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral college votes, mr trump won by roughly 68,000 votes, and in wisconsin, which has ten such votes, his margin was even smaller: just 27,000. michigan, which carries 14 votes, is still too close to call, with the difference between the two candidates amounting to fewer than 12,000.

mr trump collected 290 electoral college votes compared to 232 for ms clinton. for her to overturn the results, she would need to secure the votes of all three disputed states.

a group including university of michigan computer science professor alex halderman and voting rights activist john bonifaz contacted ms clintonâs campaign after seeing her tallies fell seven per cent short of expectations in counties that used electronic voting machines. ms clinton has yet to comment on the claims, or say if she supports a recount.

																			    														trump aide sean spicer confirmed friday that ret. lt. gen. mike flynn spoke to ambassador sergei kislyak on the telephone, and said the intent was to set up a call between russian president vladimir putin and trump once he becomes president.

																			    														the contact began, spicer said, on christmas day, with flynn and kislyak exchanging holiday greetings via text message.
															
																			    														on december 28 ã¢ââ the day before the sanctions announcement ã¢ââ kislyak sent flynn a text message asking if they could speak by phone, spicer said, and flynn accepted. the call occurred the next day, spicer said. he denied that it had anything to do with the sanctions.
															
																			    														spicer said there was nothing unusual about the call, but white house officials told nbc news it was not coordinated with them. it is unclear how the u.s. government became aware of the call, which was first reported by washington post columnist david ignatius, who said there were multiple calls and raised the question of whether the conversations violated the ""spirit"" of a law that bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.
															
																			    														  ignatius reported that flynn phoned russian ambassador kislyak several times on dec. 29, the day the obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 russian intelligence operatives and other punitive measures. the ap and reuters also reported that calls took place on that day. nbc news has not confirmed that information. 
															
																			    														a senior intelligence official told nbc news that the u.s. government is aware of other calls between flynn and other foreign ambassadors, but that he didn't consider those calls to be improper.
															
																			    														it would not be unusual for the communications of the russian ambassador to be under surveillance, particularly as the fbi was investigating russian hacking and other interference in the election campaign, several current and former u.s. officials told nbc news.
															
																			    														white house spokesman john earnest said the contacts were not necessarily problematic.""
															
																			    														""you can imagine why these kinds of interactions may have taken place, why the incoming national security adviser may have the need to contact the representative of a foreign government based here in washington d.c.,"" earnest told reporters friday. ""it depends on what they discussedã¢ââ¦in terms of whether or not we would have significant objections about those conversations.""
															
																			    														in his column, however, ignatius invoked the logan act. ""what did flynn say, and did it undercut the u.s. sanctions?"" wrote ignatius in his column.

																		  there is a long and sordid history of car companies using ""defeat devices"" to skirt government pollution and other mandated regulations mainly because the incentives to do so are significant.  the first of these devices turned off the newly mandated emission systems when people used the air conditioning. another device was a sensor that activated pollution controls only at the temperature regulators used during the tests.   
															
																			    														  recent devices sensed when government devices were attached and calibrated the engine to perform in a manner consistent with what the government considered acceptable results.  the car manufacturers are incented to do this because of the need to meet the challenging regulations set forth by governments world-wide with regard to things like emissions and fuel efficiency.  these are difficult problems to solve and one way to solve it is to give the government what it wants, just not in the way it wants it. 
															
																			    														   vw and fiat chrysler are just the latest to come up with ways to manage the demanding and at times, conflicting government regulations imposed on them by countries.  the vw situation is more rare with an admission of guilt and charges being brought against vw employees.  the fiat chrysler situation is going to be more of what is seen in the future with the government claiming a company is cheating, the company saying it is complying and the devil is in the software details. 
															
																						
												    														  your car is a robot.  this gives manufacturers a lot of flexibility when implementing new features that humans demand and also managing government regulations.  your car/robot can execute actions just like a human does when driving though it comes at the expense of having to use a huge amount of software.  humans driving a car and driverless cars execute individual decisions thousands of times every second.  we use our brains and the car uses software. 
															
																			    														   the bad side is that the software in the car that makes these decisions allows companies to implement an approach to managing government-mandated regulations in ways we might call unethical and illegal.  code to implement the equivalent of defeat devices are easily programmed in and when detected can be characterized as a ""software defect"" that can be fixed with a software upgrade to the car.   
															
																			    														  sometimes the regulations and their nomenclature is imprecise so determining if the software is helping a car meet or defeat a regulation can be problematic.  so far, manufacturers have paid fines and done recalls to the dealer so that the software can be updated. maybe the car owner will purchase an oil change or new tires while they are there.  everyone wins? 
															
																			    														   car software is proprietary meaning that no one can view the source code and analyze it for defects and there is no oversight to ensure the right decisions are made when creating the software and updating it.  there is also a long and sordid history of companies resisting this level of public transparency.  and the dynamic seen with vw and now with fiat chrysler is not just a ""car"" thing.  this same issue is present in any complex software system such as medical devices, electronic health records, electronic voting machines, and other automated systems that now do what humans did.  
															
																			    														the ugly side of our insatiable desire for better and better technology will see more fiat chrysler events until the technology providers are incented not to create better defeat devices.  and more government regulations are not the solution ã¢ââ they just incent the creation of better defeat devices. 
															
																			    														   a good start?  make the car software open to the public.  it is called transparency.

																		  americans may have opted for change in the white house, but in statehouses across the country, politicians and bureaucrats are trying to figure out how to manage the most drastic presidential transition in recent history.
															
																			    														  ""uncertainty is part and parcel of every transition,"" said john hicks, executive director of the national association of state budget officers, ""but i would say this one is a bit different because of the scope and the scale of some of the things being discussed are larger than we've seen in recent years.""
															
																			    														  hicks says 47 states are working on their budgets for the fiscal year that begins in mid-2017 (kentucky, virginia and wyoming are in the middle of two-year budget cycles).
															
																						
												    														  about all they can do is to base their budgets on current federal policies, with the knowledge that they will have to make adjustments soon.
															
																			    														  in the state with the largest budget, california, democratic gov. jerry brown on tuesday unveiled a hold-the-line $122.5 billion proposal that he called the most difficult budget in years. he warned of a potential $2 billion shortfall that could worsen, depending on what comes out of washington.
															
																			    														  ""there are too many uncertainties that could put a massive hole in our budget expectations, so that's just another argument to be prudent,"" he told reporters.
															
																			    																 
																		the biggest uncertainty is the future of health care, with president-elect donald trump and congressional republican leaders promising a quick repeal of the affordable care act, but offering no clear picture of what will replace it.
															
																			    														  california is one of 31 states that expanded its medicaid program under the law, taking advantage of more than $19 billion in federal aid for the expansion in the current fiscal year. without those funds, the state will face tough decisions about the 6 million people who gained coverage under the expansion. 
															
																			    														  they include 29-year-old charis hill of sacramento, who has a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects her spine. before the expansion of medicaid, she said, she had to rely on charity to cover expensive infusions of the drug remicade, which she requires every eight weeks. 
															
																			    														  ""i'm terrified,"" she said. ""these infusions and any type of insurance keeps me alive, and if i lose my coverage, i feel like i'm threatened to get all of my coverage through hospital emergency rooms, and that is not how to manage a chronic disease."" 
															
																			    														  even some republican governors  âincluding john kasich of ohio and rick snyder of michigan, both of whom approved medicaid expansions in their states â are urging caution when it comes to repeal. but hicks says every state is on edge. 
															
																			    														  ""for all 50 states who administer medicaid programs, states are very concerned about other changes that might take place with the medicaid program outside of the medicaid expansion that would potentially put an undue burden on state budgets,"" hicks said. 
															
																			    														  among the changes under consideration is to replace the program with block grants to the states, allowing more flexibility, but likely reducing the amount of aid.
															
																			    																 
																		health care is not the only source of uncertainty. states are already dealing with slowing or declining tax revenues as the national recovery loses steam.
															
																			    														  in california, the slowdown is modest, but brown says it's a warning sign. 
															
																			    														  ""the tendency, the inevitable move is that when we're toward the end of a recovery, we have all this money and people want to spend. that's the very time when you have to pull in and provide a budget reserve,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  hicks says roughly half the states are projecting lower revenues. several have already made mid-year budget adjustments. he says federal tax reform promised by trump and the republican congress would add even more wrinkles. 
															
																			    														  in fact, he says, even the anticipation of lower marginal tax rates could play havoc with revenues next year. 
															
																			    														  ""it's possible that individuals have already deferred some of their capital gains and other non-wage income to calendar year 2017 to potentially take advantage of lower tax rates during that period,"" he said. ""if that's the case, states are going to find out this spring when final returns are filed with state personal income taxes to where they may be lower than estimates."" 
															
																			    																 
																		  states are also worried about a change in the tax status of municipal bonds, hicks says. if, for example, congress tried to offset the impact of income tax cuts by ending tax-free treatment of municipal bonds, states could lose crucial borrowing power. 
															
																			    														  ""states want to at least communicate with washington that the tax exemption has a wide slate of benefits to state governments and the citizens in states because it lowers the price of borrowing for when you have to borrow to finance infrastructure,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  at the same time, states are likely salivating at the prospect of a major federal infrastructure, a top priority of trump. 
															
																			    														  ""that is something on a positive note that states are interested in becoming partners with the federal government on,"" hicks said. 
															
																			    														  correction: charis hill of sacramento has a chronic inflammatory disorder. an earlier version mischaracterized the disorder. 
															
																			    																  
																		  inside twitter's headquarters in san francisco, the run-up to the u.s. presidential election played out much as it did elsewhere. most employees went about their business assuming hillary clinton  would win, and donald trump would be relegated to a historical footnote. his antics on the platform, where he regularly barrages opponents with insults, were viewed largely with amusement.

																			    														  ""the political climate then was still pretty giddy about trump and how he's a total joke,"" said one employee who quit late last spring. but trump's surprise win prompted soul-searching for many of twitter's 3,800 employees. ""fast-forward to the day after election,"" the former employee said. ""i could feel it in my timeline â there was a strong sense of 'what have we done' from twitter employees."" 
															
																						
												    														  on one hand, trump has arguably been a gift to twitter. his regular outbursts have put the struggling company at the center of the daily news cycle, drawing outsized attention to the product at a time when it is struggling to grow. and trump's willingness to tweet about nearly any topic has given the world a valuable, if not entirely coherent, window into the president-elect's views. 
															
																			    														  at the same time, trump's tweets have drawn criticism for the way they have sent certain stock prices tumbling, and ratcheting up tensions with foreign governments. (trump's twitter account might also be a national security problem.) twitter has also been accused of empowering white supremacist trolls in the wake of trump's electoral win.
															
																			    														  yesterday, in an interview with the new york times, investor peter thiel mocked twitter employees for what he described as their unwitting contribution to trump's victory. ""i think the crazy thing is, at a place like twitter, they were all working for trump this whole year even though they thought they were working for sanders.""
															
																			    														  that tension puts twitter employees in an awkward position: their efforts have bolstered a politician that some of them find odious, and his use of the platform carries a real risk of harm. and yet thanks largely to his victory, twitter has never been such a vital source of news and conversation. the conflict is felt at the highest levels of the company â last month, in a conversation with recode, ceo jack dorsey said his thoughts on the subject were ""complicated."" 
															
																			    														  ""twitter helped in promoting trump,"" twitter engineer marina zhao tweeted. ""twitter helped in spreading falsehoods and lies."" ""and refused to do anything about blatant naziism,"" responded michael farrell, a designer who left the company in 2015. ""they stated they wouldn't take action until after the election. disgusting.""
															
																			    														  in the weeks leading up to trump's inauguration, that debate has only intensified. some of trump's tweets, notably his erratic tweets about nuclear policy, have generated calls for twitter to ban the president-elect from the platform. those discussions are now taking place inside twitter as well, a current employee familiar with the matter told the verge. ""banning is definitely a conversation that people are having, but only because we have to have the conversation,"" the employee said. but a ban seems unlikely, this person said. ""it would take something really deplorable for a ban, and i highly doubt even trump is that stupid."" 
															
																			    														  twitter declined to comment for this story, but a spokesman noted that twitter's rules ""apply to all accounts."" still, one former employee who has participated in discussions about the company's abuse policies said that a ban would be unimaginable. ""it's not gonna happen,"" the former employee said. ""you just can't do it. he holds the most powerful office in the world. would you rather not know what trump was thinking at any given point? knowledge is usually better than lack of knowledge.""
															
																			    														  twitter was prominently omitted from the list of tech companies invited to meet with trump last month. but representatives from twitter met this week with dan scavino, trump's director of social media, and it appeared to go well. ""great meeting @twitterdc!"" scavino tweeted. ""we look forward to working with you!""
															
																			    														  even as employees lament the role their platform played in trump's rise, they acknowledge that in some ways he has been good for the company. twitter was designed to let users communicate directly with a large audience; that the most powerful man in the world does so would seem to speak well of the product. ""it's nice to feel like twitter is doing what it was meant to do, i.e., bring news from the horse's mouth,"" one employee said. ""unfortunately, that horse is trump."" 
															
																			    														  conversely, trump leaving twitter would bode ill for the company, employees said. were trump to shift the bulk of his posts to facebook or snapchat, outsiders would likely take it as a sign that twitter was on the wane. ""that would be an even worse predicament for the company than the one they face now,"" an employee who left this summer said.
															
																			    														  twitter employees also noted that the platform has been a tool for liberal organizing just as much as it has been a megaphone for trump supporters. the company has long taken pride in the way democratic protesters used it during the arab spring, and at one point it had a #blacklivesmatter hashtag painted outside its cafeteria. twitter is likely to serve as a tool for resistance at the same time it serves as a platform to promote trump's agenda.
															
																			    														  ""now the tenor has shifted to, you know how we've talked internally about how twitter is a tool of dissidence and rebellion, and keeping governments accountable? now this plays a little more critical role in the domestic side of things,"" one former employee said. ""that's the role our platform plays. the same way it was vital in the arab spring, twitter will play that same vital role in the united states."" 
															
																			    																 
									  
																		  you know the old saying: ""man plans and god laughs."" and when it comes to environmental regulations, governments make rules, and the automakers laugh. and they laugh because they can and do cheat those rules in more ways than you can imagine. today's charges that fiat chrysler used deceptive software to cover up diesel emissions could be just the latest example of that, but most of the ways around government environmental laws are 100 percent legal. and that's led to a culture of cheating and deception for years.
															
																			    														  just to clarify, what the epa is accusing fiat chrysler of doing and what volkswagen has admitted to doing by using the software are both crimes. they are not allowed as part of some kind of legislative loophole. but they are a result of a culture that has encouraged less-than-upstanding tricks and semantic games to evade the real intent of emissions curbing laws.  
															
																			    														  government rules mandating emissions maximums and mileage standards have been around for a long time, but they took on a new urgency in 2011 when the obama administration set a new standard of 54.5 miles per gallon for new cars and trucks by 2025. america's big car makers publicly supported the move, but that was probably at least in part because they knew they had a few tricks up their sleeve. of course they did, since they had been legally skirting them for a long time already.  
															
																						
												    														  it would take too long to list all the tricks and loopholes   the auto industry and its lobbyists have used over the years to game the emissions and mileage rules. but some of the greatest hits include making rear seats removable from smaller vehicles to get them reclassifying as ""storage bearing suv's or light trucks,"" manufacturing super small cars they know won't sell very well just to bring down overall fleet mileage averages, installing ""skip shift"" devices into sports cars that almost all users knew how to disable, producing ""flex fuel"" vehicles that can use ethanol but almost no one does, and making suv's meant for passengers just a little bigger to get them classified as heavy duty trucks with correspondingly more lax emissions rules.   
															
																			    														again, all of the above were legal loopholes the automakers and their lawyers spent a lot of effort working on over the years. and it's hard to believe those public and private moves didn't send a clear message to everyone in the industry that washington's environmental rules are simply an obstacle to be gamed out and defeated. actually reducing emissions, or making the vehicles most of us drive more fuel efficient, is just the line they pretend to uphold. 
															
																			    														but wait! haven't cars actually become more fuel efficient anyway? yes, on the most part they have. but that's mostly because that's what the consumers have demanded from the industry after two rounds of $4 a gallon national gas prices over the past decade. in the end, it's the market that will be the real catalyst for more environmentally friendly cars and not the government. 
															
																			    														that doesn't mean that we should go without any regulations at all, even on emissions and mileage. but the rules need to be written more clearly, with no loopholes, and fewer opportunities for lobbyists to sully the process. and the easiest way to do that is to focus solely on reducing the worst kinds of pollution that are easy to detect and easy to enforce. mandating averages like 54.5 mpg within eight years from now is not an example of a reasonable goal... not without encouraging more cheating and chicanery that is.  
															
																			    														what we have now is a cynically politicized process filled with players who don't really care that much about protecting the environment as they do about scoring political points. it's no wonder vw and possibly fiat chrysler decided to cheat even more blatantly given the culture of deception and trickery connected to the whole process for so long. and no one should be surprised if more automakers get caught using cheating software or other blatantly illegal scams. meanwhile, consumers will reward the companies the make the best vehicles with the best fuel efficiency in the long run. let's give them more power than the government currently does to make that happen.

																		  despite donald trump's campaign pledge to ""drain the swamp"" in washington, the president-elect hasn't ""done enough"" to address his own ethics issues and potential business conflicts, vice president joe biden told nbc news' andrea mitchell on thursday. 
															
																			    														  more from nbc news:former british spy christopher steele prepared explosive trump memoben carson doesn't rule out trump benefiting from hud money  though well-liked, 'mad dog' mattis faces obstacles to confirmation as defense secretary 
															
																			    														  ""i don't think he's done enough and he may sink in the swamp,"" biden told nbc news, referring to trump's refusal to release his taxes and other issues concerning his vast business holdings. ""if you don't drain it, you sink in it."" 
															
																						
												    														  ""are you going to be president or are you going to be a businessman? you don't do both. you ran for the most coveted office in the world,"" biden added. 
															
																			    														  trump vowed in a new ethics plan outlined on wednesday that his business interests would not pose a problem ã¢ââ but biden said his financial deals shouldn't even be brought up now that he's been elected. 
															
																			    														  ""focus on your job. that's the job,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  in the wide-ranging interview, biden also touched on trump's differences with the intelligence community, vladimir putin, and the vice president's cancer moonshot program. 
															
																			    														  biden addressed the controversy around an explosive, unverified report that russia had compromising information on trump, and criticized trump for denigrating u.s. intelligence in public statements, including on twitter. 
															
																			    														  in response to a question about whether it had been a mistake for the u.s. intelligence community to include a summary of that report in briefing materials, biden said officials felt an ""obligation to inform not only us but the president-elect that this was out there."" 
															
																			    														  trump on wednesday held his first press conference in six months, a testy briefing in which he sparred with reporters over the unverified report. in a tweet early wednesday, trump lashed out at the intelligence community, saying of the leak of the report: ""are we living in nazi germany?"" 
															
																			    														  biden on thursday said he hopes trump will adopt a more favorable view of u.s. intelligence after being sworn in. 
															
																			    														  ""once he has the mantle of being president, sitting behind that desk every morning, my hope and expectation is that he will become significantly more informed how they work, how they function, how good they are,"" biden said. 
															
																			    														  biden said he didn't regret not running against trump because ""i just wasn't prepared to do it after i lost my son."" but, he added, ""do i regret that my point of view is not going to be reflected in the next administration because we have mr. trump? yeah, i do regret that."" 
															
																			    														  comparing the end of the obama era to the final days of high school, when students pass around yearbooks, he joked his yearbook quote to trump would be: ""lots of luck in your senior year, mr. trump."" 
															
																			    														  biden on sunday is scheduled to make a swansong visit to ukraine, one of the baltic nations that has expressed anxiety over the incoming presidency following a trump remark that he wasn't sure whether baltic states should have nato protection from neighboring russia until they ""have fulfilled their obligations to us."" 
															
																			    														
															
																			    																 
									  
																		  president-elect donald trump and republicans in congress have voluntarily put themselves under extreme pressure to put together an obamacare replacement plan as soon as possible. and they're moving full speed ahead: a midnight budget resolution vote cleared the way for aca repeal, even after five gop senators publicly appealed for a delay to the process.   
															
																			    														  so, is obamacare repeal turning into a kamikaze-style piece of political suicide? the answer is no, because it's likely the leaders of the ""repeal it now"" movement are going to lean on some political and public relations tricks and gimmicks: they're going to keep more of the existing parts of obamacare than expected, tweak a few others and publicize a few new ideas to get the biggest public relations effect.  
															
																			    														  1) drafting a plan and implementing it are two different things 
															
																						
												    														  so far, all we've heard from trump and the other more aggressive replacement advocates is a call to get an obamacare replacement ""drafted"" or ""passed."" that's a heck of a lot easier than putting a new plan into effect. and more importantly, it's the best and most likely way out of the biggest risk involved in ditching the aca, which would be the angry reaction of millions of americans potentially getting insurance cancellation notices in the mail. the good news is that passing a plan and then waiting a year or two to put it into effect is a process the public is used to with big government programs. 
															
																			    														  2) they don't have to start from scratch. they already have medicaid  
															
																			    														  much of the existing aca infrastructure is not only good, but contains many attributes trump and republicans at least claim to like. first and foremost, you have a national website where millions of americans go to shop, compare, and sign up for health insurance. trump and the republicans have been calling for years to allow health insurers to compete across state lines and the existing aca website is there to facilitate that process.  
															
																			    														  but it will also be essential because the replacement plans we've seen so far from the republicans all include putting more responsibility and choice into the hands of consumers when it comes to getting their own health insurance. using tax credits and other funding pathways to do that is the hard part, but thanks to the aca and that website the ""buying health insurance for yourself"" part is easy. 
															
																			    														some of the other aspects of the aca that aren't as popular with republicans will still likely remain because it's too easy to keep them and too hard or politically toxic to trash them. chief among them is medicaid and the expansion of it that most states accepted as part of the obamacare plan. political optics plays a big role in this part of the deal, because throwing millions of the poorest americans off of medicaid rolls would look even worse than throwing middle class people off of their private insurance plans.  
															
																			    														  but there's a silver lining here for the replacement process, and it comes from a very surprising source: controversial economist and obamacare architect jonathan gruber, you'll recall that gruber was the one who publicly said that the passage and construction of obamacare regulations relied on ""the stupidity of the american voter."" but gruber has a new study out that shows that the clear majority, (70 percent) of the americans who supposedly became eligible for medicaid because obamacare loosened the requirements were actually eligible all along.    
															
																			    														  in other words, obamacare's biggest impact may not have been the creation of anything but new awareness of a very old government program dedicated to the simple idea of getting health care to the people who have the most trouble affording it. and this provides trump and the republicans with a major escape pod and fast track towards passing and implementing an obamacare replacement.  
															
																			    														  remember that the big reason why so many mostly red state governors rejected the medicaid expansions in their states was because they feared the federal aid money to fund the expansion would eventually end and then the new enrollees would become another unfunded state burden. but the gruber report shows that 70 percent of those new medicaid users were already the federal government's responsibility.  
															
																			    														  of course, this would probably put added pressure on washington to do something about those growing medicaid costs. but that will be a lot easier to do than crafting and funding an obamacare replacement. look for medicaid and promises to boost funding for it to become a key cornerstone of the republican replacement plan.   
															
																			    														  3)  window dressing is easy 
															
																			    														  a cereal company can add a minuscule new ingredient to its product and get away with calling it ""new and improved."" politicians can do that too, and obamacare is filled with opportunities to make little tweaks here and there. some very small degree of tort reform, which was discussed before the aca was passed, is one example. and targeted tax credits to help people set up health savings accounts would be another. we know trump is a master at public relations and certainly has the ability to make many possible small changes seem big or at least trick us all into talking about them for some time.  
															
																			    														  but make no mistake, there still is no fully fleshed out gop plan to replace obamacare. we still need to hear more details on the call to use tax credits to make health insurance for the middle class and rich more portable and not reliant on employers. we still need to know how risk pools will be funded properly to make sure the sickest and most costly health care consumers don't lose access. 
															
																			    														and again, how the gop and the white house are going to get that added funding medicaid needs either way is a complete mystery right now. a lot of those blanks will be filled in over the coming days and weeks, but there's a good chance the republicans will be pushing a message not unlike nancy pelosi's infamous, ""we have to pass it to see what's in it,"" comment. 
															
																			    														  the obamacare replacement plan will be a lot about the packaging. and that's trump's best strength. his confidence in puffing his brand and products is probably a big reason why he's pushing the republican congress to hurry up and get a plan passed that he can promote. the president-elect is betting that no matter how quick and dirty the new plan is, he'll be able to sell it to most of the american people.

																		  regular citizens on the streets of tokyo said they were nervous about what a trump presidency would bring in terms of trade ties and more.

																			    														  ""i wasn't surprised by his remarks but i wonder whether he actually has the power to go through with his threats,"" the 32-year-old said. 
															
																			    														  on wednesday, the president-elect called out japan ã¢ââ one of the u.s.'s most important allies and trading partners ã¢ââ as an example of a country where america made ""bad deals."" 
															
																			    														  ""we have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis ã¢ââ hundreds of billions with china on trade and trade imbalance, with japan, with mexico, with just about everybody. we don't make good deals anymore,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  officials, meanwhile, emphasized the importance of strong trade ties between the two countries. 
															
																			    														  ""robust trade and investments serve as the main source for a vibrant japan-u.s. economic relationship,"" japan's chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told journalists in tokyo. ""this is free trade, something that the united states advocates, and we believe [trump] will continue to push forward these things."" 
															
																			    														  suga, who is the government's main spokesman, went on to use u.s. government statistics to underline japan's importance to america: japanese investment in the u.s. stands at $411 billion and has created 840,000 jobs. 
															
																			    														  ""i think we can say that japanese companies are already being recognized as good corporate citizens in the united states,"" suga added.

""it's hard to say how he'll impact us, he's a pretty two-faced man, a complicated man. unpredictable. you can expect anything from him. 
															
																			    														  while calling him ""a sly man, not as simple as he wants to look,"" she said that russian intelligence services could well have hacked u.s. accounts in an effort to influence the election as they have been accused of. 
															
																			    														  ""it's possible ã¢ââ our guys are totally capable of this,"" smirnova said. 
															
																			    														  english teacher anatoly mukhachyov said he just hoped for the best. 
															
																			    														  ""i hope that with donald trump's arrival, the relations between russia and the united states will change,"" the 67-year-old said. 
															
																			    																 
																		  china was a focus of trump's criticism throughout the press conference with the president-elect trump calling out beijing for hacking attacks, taking ""total advantage of us economically"" and building up artificial islands in contested waters in the south china sea. 
															
																			    														  victor gao, the director of the china national association of international studies and chinese leader deng xiaoping's former interpreter, said trump was trying to deflect attention from recent reports about his alleged ties to russia by lashing out at china. 
															
																			    														  donald trump is ""fiercely defending his own reputation by shifting the attention from russia to china,"" he said, calling the president-elect ""very much misguided.""

																			    														  ""i think a politician should avoid making groundless conclusions,"" said the 52-year-old resident of beijing. ""it's better if they make statements after the relevant departments' analysis. it's more convincing if what you say is backed by evidence."" 
															
																			    														  chang moujun, a 30-year-old beijing finance worker, downplayed the president-elect's comments, adding that even if china was involved in hacking so was the u.s. 
															
																			    														  ""his intention is to attract attention. after all, he hasn't taken office yet. he might tone down a little after he officially assumes office,"" he said. 
															
																			    																 
																		  professor tobias endler described trump's behavior as laughable at times, but he also criticized the president-elect for invoking nazi-era germany, to describe the press' treatment of recent salacious and unconfirmed reports about his ties to russia. 
															
																			    														  ""i had to grin several times,"" the professor of american studies at heidelberg university told nbc news' partner zdf. ""but in regard to the power of the office you choke on the laughter. trump's speech reminded of a sitcom, which at the end was more like a horror comedy."" 
															
																			    														  before and during the press conference trump said it was ""disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake outã¢ââ¦ something that nazi germany would have done and did do."" 
															
																			    														  endler responded to this by saying: 
															
																			    														  ""trump repeated this in the press conference and gave room to conspiracy theories. 'lying press,' which spreads fake news and takes a last shot at him. trump [presents] himself as a potential victim. the comparison to nazi germany is impossible. that is belittling, distorting and an insult to the victims of nazi germany."" 
															
																			    																 
																		  haim dekel said that while he liked trump's personality, he was worried about the effects of a trump presidency. 
															
																			    														  ""he has a great personality, is a daring and crazy guy,"" the 61-year-old pilot said. ""you never know what's going to happen with him. he is childish and now the world is a big playground for him.""
															
																			    														  dekel added: ""i don't think he is going to do good for my country ã¢ââ it looks as if he is going to be good, but its going to be disaster.
															
																			    														  trump has criticized recent president barack obama decisions related to to israel ã¢ââ most recently the administration's decision to abstain from a united nations resolution labeling israeli settlements in the west bank illegal. 
															
																			    																 
																		  in the west bank, ahmad safi, a 38-year-old palestinian government worker, said trump's reported ties to russia foreshadowed moscow's resurgence as a power in the middle east. 
															
																			    														  ""it is a time for russia to be a part of the middles east while it was disappeared for a long time,"" he said. ""i think the time now is for russia to be ruling this area."" 
															
																			    														  safi went on to say that he thought trump was the right leader for the u.s. ã¢ââ but not for the reasons many americans would hope. 
															
																			    														  ""he's the best man to represent the usa because he will take it down. no one can attack america from outside,"" he said. ""if anyone wants to take it from inside it must donald trump.""

																		  after debating seven hours through the night, the senate voted early thursday to take the first real step toward repealing obamacare â a top goal of congressional republicans and president-elect donald trump. 
															
																			    														  senators voted 51-48 to approve a budget resolution that republicans will use as a vehicle to speed through repeal of the affordable care act, better known as obamacare. house leaders plan to take it up friday. 
															
																			    														  senators began voting on 19 amendments to the resolution about 6:30 p.m. wednesday before passing the budget measure about 1:30 a.m. thursday. 
															
																						
												    																 
																		republicans said the 2010 health care law is broken and must be repealed and replaced with something better â although just what that replacement plan will look like has not yet been revealed by congressional leaders. critics of the law cite sky-rocketing premiums, high deductibles and fewer health care choices for patients as insurers pull out of the program.
															
																			    														  ""when obamacare's supporters forced their partisan law on our country, they promised an easy-to-use system; one that would lower premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs; one that would foster choice and allow families to keep the plans and doctors they liked,"" said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky. 
															
																			    														  ""but it didn't take long for the american people to discover the truth about obamacare. too many have been personally hurt by this law. too many feel they're worse off than they were before obamacare.""

																			    														  democrats said repealing the law will strip millions of americans of insurance, leave people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to find coverage, and increase the nation's budget deficit by $353 billion over the next 10 years as the tax and fee provisions that pay for obamacare are gutted. 
															
																			    														  ""ripping apart our health care system â with no plan to replace it â will create chaos,"" said sen. patty murray of washington, the senior democrat on the health, education, labor and pensions committee. ""if republicans repeal the affordable care act, it's women, kids, seniors, patients with serious illnesses, and people with disabilities who will bear the burden."" 
															
																			    														  ""premiums will skyrocket,"" she continued. ""out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will rise. and overall health care costs will increase. it's a perfect storm to make america sick again â and absolutely the wrong direction for families and for our economy.""
															
																			    																 
																		while republicans are eager to repeal the affordable care act, they have acknowledged that it could cause serious problems for americans if the law is scrapped without a replacement plan ready to go.
															
																			    														  house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., told reporters tuesday that ""it is our goal to bring it all together concurrently."" 
															
																			    														  ""we're going to use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal, so that we can save people from this mess,"" ryan said. he did not offer details of what a replacement plan would include. 
															
																			    														  at a press conference wednesday, trump said he is prepared to offer a detailed replacement plan as soon as his nominee for health and human services secretary â republican rep. tom price of georgia â is confirmed by the senate. 
															
																			    														  republicans are using a procedural tactic known as budget reconciliation to prevent senate democrats from being able to block an obamacare repeal. the procedure allows the senate to pass a repeal with only a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the 60-vote super-majority required for most major bills. republicans have 52 seats in the senate. 
															
																			    														  the resolution that the senate passed early thursday directs key committees to write draft legislation by jan. 27 to repeal the health care law. some republicans want the deadline to be pushed to march to give lawmakers more time to come up with a replacement plan. 
															
																			    														  democrats offered amendments they knew would fail but that put senators on record voting for or against some of the more popular provisions of obamacare. those include a provision barring insurance companies from refusing to cover patients with pre-existing medical conditions and a provision that allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance until age 26. 
															
																			    														  republicans have said they plan to keep those provisions in whatever replacement plan they offer. 
															
																			    																 
									  
																		  french conservative francois fillon will beat far-right leader marine le pen by 63 percent to 37 percent if they meet head to head in a presidential election runoff in may, a poll showed on thursday.  
															
																			    														the pop 2017 poll was in line with the findings of other surveys showing fillon, a former prime minister, losing momentum with his share of the vote in the first round, falling to 24 percent from as much as 27.5 percent a month ago.
															
																			    																 
																		  the poll showed him trailing national front (fn) leader le pen by one or two percentage points in the first-round vote on april 23, but picking up enough votes from other defeated candidates, including from centrists among the socialists, to defeat her comfortably in the may 7 knockout.  
															
																						
												    														  however, the poll also appeared to confirm that emmanuel macron, a popular former economy minister under socialist president francois hollande who is running as an independent, might still be in a position to pull off a surprise.   
															
																			    														  macron is seen as coming in third place in the first round with 16-20 percent of the vote, the poll showed,  depending on which candidate the socialists pick for the party ticket in their primaries this month.  
															
																			    														  but he might be able to count on scooping up much of the 5 percent of the votes that the poll attributed to centrist francois bayrou if the latter decides not to run.  
															
																			    														  bayrou, a former education minister and currently mayor of pau, has social policies which are close to those of macron and so his supporters may throw their weight behind the former investment banker. bayrou has not yet said whether he will run.  
															
																			    														  the poll, which had a margin of error of 3.3 percent, was conducted by internet from jan. 6-8 and was based on a sample of 946 people registered to vote.  
															
																			    														
															
																			    																  
																		  for his first press conference since the election, i'd give president-elect donald trump a b+. 
															
																			    														  for the most part, i have to say, he is starting to sound presidential. 
															
																			    														  sure, he lost a few points in the presidential department after a heated exchange with reporters from buzzfeed and cnn where he called cnn ""fake news"" and buzzfeed a ""failing pile of garbage."" 
															
																						
												    														  however, when you look at his performance in the rest of the debate, he stayed on message, deflected the hard questions with a logical stance, and wisely brought in third parties to lend credibility to controversial issues involving conflict-of-interest concerns. 
															
																			    														  everyone was listening to see how trump would respond to the most salacious allegations that russia had titillating dirt and video on him. trump knew it would be the first and hardest question out of the gate, and he didn't allow his emotions to overrule his thoughts when approaching the topic.  
															
																			    														  trump handled the russian allegations in a professional and presidential tone. he explained candidly that he couldn't elaborate on classified briefings. it enabled him to evade the tough question on whether the u.s. intelligence community briefed him over russia allegedly having compromising video and financial documents on him. issue resolved. sure, he didn't answer the question, but most americans understand why classified details shouldn't be shared in a press conference.  
															
																			    														  when you want to change the angle of any news story, you redirect it with a better question or topic ã¢ââ and that's what trump did next. he redirected the alleged russian blackmail story with the accusations against buzzfeed and cnn. 
															
																			    														  that exchange may have gotten a little intense but trump softened his image with some humor. in response to allegations of trump engaging in salacious behavior with prostitutes in moscow, trump called himself a ""germaphobe."" it brought laughter to the room and made you think ã¢ââ eh, it's plausible. 
															
																			    														  trump's first press conference was full of wide-ranging topics and he transitioned to the questions seamlessly. from a pr perspective ã¢ââ trump brilliantly packed the room with supporters who clapped like it was a popularity contest. the media wasn't swayed by the overt support, but viewers listening at home on the later newscast might be.  
															
																			    														  few reporters were able to stump trump as well. when one reporter tried to corner him into admitting that the u.s. was now paying for the wall, contrary to his campaign promises, trump answered matter of factly with logic: he wants to get the wall built quickly, so he's not going to wait a year and a half for funding. he will start on it now and get mexico to reimburse it later.  
															
																			    														  trump finished his press conference relatively unscathed and that's why i'm giving him a b+. journalists have waited months for this opportunity to grill him on a wide-ranging series of topics. he answered their questions with logic and used his new pulpit to push his message. when you can walk away from a press conference with the world's toughest journalists, you've succeeded if you walk away without bruises. 
															
																			    														and that's what trump did.

																		  secretary of state nominee rex tillerson on wednesday said he does not support restricting travel or immigration to the united states by muslims.  
															
																			    														  ""i think what's important is that we are able to make a judgment about the people that are coming into the country, and so no, i do not support a blanket type rejection of any particular group of people,"" tillerson said during a senate confirmation hearing. 
															
																			    														  president-elect donald trump vowed to temporarily ban muslim travel and immigration to the country after a wave of terrorist attacks carried out or inspired by the islamic state in europe and the united states.  
															
																						
												    														  he has since walked back that promise, instead saying he would ban immigration from countries where terrorism is prevalent. 
															
																			    														  tillerson said the united states must win the war against islamic terrorists not just on the battlefield, but must triumph in the war of ideas.   
															
																			    														  ""one of our greatest allies in this war is going to be the moderate voices of muslim, people of the muslim faith who speak from their perspective and their rejection of that representation of what is otherwise a great faith,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  tillerson said he would require more information on how the government would approach constructing a registry of muslims before he would consider lending his support to creating one. 
															
																			    														  ""i would need to have a lot more information around how such an approach would even be constructed. and if it were a tool for vetting, then it probably extends to other people as well â other groups that are threats to the u.s.,"" he said. 
															
																			    														  trump has not formally called for the creation of a database of muslims living in the united states. however, he has expressed his openness to the possibility â though in somewhat unclear terms â when questioned about the prospect by reporters. 
															
																			    														  asked in november during an appearance on abc news' ""this week"" whether he would rule out such a database, he said ""no, not at all."" 
															
																			    														  ""we want to go with watchlists. we want to go with databases. and we have no choice,"" trump said. 
															
																			    																  
																		  he talked about the russia scandal. he talked about divesting from his businesses. but the one thing that came out of president-elect donald trump's long-awaited news conference wednesday that could affect the most americans in the most vital way was his unexpected targeting of the drug industry. trump wants drug prices down and it's past time for that industry to get serious about making a deal. 
															
																			    														  trump's words had an immediate impact on pharma and biotech stock prices. they tanked. but the longer term impact could be much more profound. he has pointed out the problem of higher drug prices before, but the way he defined the drug industry wednesday was something new. 
															
																			    														first, he talked about the drug industry a manufacturing industry. and just like the way he's singled out car companies, he talked about how the drug companies are leaving the u.s., but still selling their products here. this important definition/characterization opens the door to a whole new way of negotiating with the drug companies. 
															
																						
												    														all of sudden, it's possible for them to be like carrier or ford or fiat chrysler and try to curry favor with the new president by promising to bring back or save u.s. jobs in its remaining drug manufacturing plants. if the big pharma ceos are smart, they should start thinking about doing that right away. 
															
																			    														  but unfortunately for them, trump didn't stop there. he reminded the audience that the u.s. is the biggest buyer of drugs in the world and he went on to promise a better bidding procedure to get prices down. the most memorable moment may have been when he described the drug industry with the loaded and powerful term: ""they're getting away with murder."" now you know why those drug stocks tanked so fast.  
															
																			    														  of course trump is right, the u.s. government alone is the biggest buyer of drugs in the world through medicare and medicaid. those two programs for older and poorer americans, respectively, actually make us the biggest single payer health care system on earth even though we also have a private insurance system for everyone else. 
															
																			    														it's always been puzzling to businessmen and businesswomen in america why our government doesn't use that leverage to negotiate lower prices on all prescription drugs. but they're forgetting the great wisdom of nobel prize winning economist milton friedman, who always taught that the worst price inflation comes when someone in the government is in charge of using someone else's money to provide goods and services to yet another party. trump is essentially promising to change all that and he seems poised to hire just enough non-government bureaucrat types in his cabinet to actually make it happen.  
															
																			    														  but speaking of politics, the political support for this kind of ""get tough"" policy with the drug companies is very high. just imagine if president obama or senator elizabeth warren had used those exact, ""they're getting away with murder,"" words about big pharma. the entire liberal and a great deal of the moderate voter bases would be cheering loudly. trump has the added burden of actually having to deliver on reducing drug prices before he gets those kinds of cheers, but at least he can count on his efforts to do so being very popular along the way.  
															
																			    														  and that's not only bad news for the drug companies, but all the other countries in the developed world who benefit from the fact that we pay more for the same drugs. in other words, canada, britain, france, etc. only pay less because the drug companies make up those losses or lower profits by charging america more. their party could soon be over. but that's a big part of the new definition of ""america first."" 
															
																			    														  so, should everyone start to expect lower prices and potentially significantly lower profits for drug companies? should investors take their money out of the entire pharma sector? worse yet, will the long-held conservative belief that essentially enforcing price controls on these products lead to drug shortages and stunted medical innovation? there's a very good chance both of those ill effects could result based on what we've seen before with even essential drug treatments like the flu vaccine. is there a way out of all of that? 
															
																			    														  the answer could be yes if trump and his team follow through on their promise to be real, non-political deal makers. trump loves that image of being a businessman and not a politician and a politician would be more than happy to see prices go down no matter what the longer term effects would be. 
															
																			    														but if the drug companies do have a sympathetic ear of a fellow business leader at the table, they could get somewhere by describing their liabilities and other costs that they say force them to charge so much for certain drugs. if they're smart enough to ask for some government relief in that area, from drug tort reform to bigger tax breaks for costly research and development, some kind of price relief just might happen without those worst case scenario side effects.  
															
																			    														  and finally, there's a chance the two sides could meet in the middle when it comes to regulatory relief. helping the industry get more new drugs to market quickly is something a trump administration could do with everything from relaxing the fda approval process to allowing terminally ill patients easier access to experimental drugs.   
															
																			    														  the bottom line is that after wednesday's news conference, big pharma better be ready to deal with the trump team for real. and ""ready to deal,"" does not mean hiring more or better lobbyists like it has in the past. the drug industry definitely has some things to offer the new administration to soften the blow, but trump wants drug prices to go down and he has the power to make life very unpleasant for the companies that don't comply.

																		  president-elect donald trump called the unverified allegations about russian information gathering on him ""fake news"" on wednesday, and one former cia analyst is backing him up. 
															
																			    														  the 35-page document, published by buzzfeed on tuesday evening, contains explosive allegations of his ties to russia, as well as accusations of salacious activities. 
															
																			    														  ""as a former cia analyst, i can say with complete confidence â¦ that those leaked memos are as fake as the play money you would buy at a toy store,"" george david banks said in an interview with ""power lunch"" on wednesday.  
															
																						
												    														  banks, who is now executive vice president of the american council for capital formation, didn't go into further details on why he came to that conclusion.  
															
																			    														  however, if one were to assume it was real, it would show that ""russian counterintelligence is in total disarray,"" he pointed out.  
															
																			    														  during his first postelection news conference on wednesday, trump blasted buzzfeed as a ""failing pile of garbage"" and said the online media outlet ""will suffer the consequences."" 
															
																			    														  the russian government on wednesday called the report a ""total hoax."" 
															
																			    														  tuesday evening, buzzfeed editor-in-chief ben smith tweeted an email he said to his staff that said, in part, that the site decided to publish the dossier so that americans can make up their own minds. on wednesday, buzzfeed told cnbc it stands by its decision. 
															
																			    														  on tuesday, nbc news reported that sources said briefing materials prepared for president-elect donald trump included damaging allegations about his dealings with russians. the information was initially circulated among trump opponents before being passed to u.s. intelligence agencies, according to nbc news.

																		  on wednesday, president-elect donald trump held his first news conference since his election in november. this is a transcript from the press conference.  
															
																			    														  thank you very much. it's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. i think we probably, maybe won the nomination because of news conferences, and it's good to be with you. 
															
																			    														  we stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news. but i do have to say that, and i must say that, i want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today. because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they, in fact, did that, a tremendous blot, because a thing like that should never have been written, it should never have been had, and it should certainly never have been released. 
															
																						
												    														  but i want to thank a lot of the news organizations for, some of whom have not treated me very well over the years, a couple in particular, and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station. 
															
																			    														  so, i just want to compliment many of the people in the room. i have great respect for the news and have great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but i will tell you, there were some news organizations, with all that was just said, that were so professional, so incredibly professional, that i've just gone up a notch as to what i think of you, ok? all right. 
															
																			    														  we've had some great news over the last couple of weeks. i've been quite active, i guess you could say, in an economic way, for the country. a lot of car companies are going to be moving in. we have other companies. 
															
																			    														  big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are going to be building in the midwest. you saw yesterday fiat chrysler, big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. 
															
																			    														  ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion-dollar plant in mexico. and they're going to be moving into michigan and expanding very substantially an existing plant. 
															
																			    														  i appreciate that from ford. i appreciate it very much from fiat chrysler. i hope that general motors will be following, and i think they will be. 
															
																			    														  i think a lot of people will be following. i think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. we have to get our drug industry coming back. our drug industry has been disastrous. they're leaving left and right. they supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. and the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they're getting away with murder. 
															
																			    														  pharma. pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power, and there's very little bidding on drugs. we're the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet, we don't bid properly. and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time, and we're going to do that with a lot of other industries. 
															
																			    														  i'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the f-35. you've been reading about it. and it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. i don't like that, and the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. i've really gotten to know them well, and we're going to do some big things on the f-35 program, and perhaps the f-18 program, and we're going to get those costs way down, and we're going to get the plane to be even better, and we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing. 
															
																			    														  so we've been very, very much involved. and other things. we had jack ma. we had so many incredible people coming here. they're going to do tremendous things in this country, and they're very excited. and i will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here, they would not be in my office or anybody else's office. 
															
																			    														  they'd be building and doing things in other countries. so there's a great spirit going on right now, a spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever. we're going to create jobs. i said that i will be the greatest jobs producer that god ever created, and i mean that. 
															
																			    														  i really â i'm going to work very hard on that we need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but i think we're going to do a real job, and i'm very proud of what we've done, and we haven't even gotten there yet. i look very much forward to the inauguration, it's going to be a beautiful event. we have great talent, tremendous talent, and we have all of the bands or most of the bands from the different segments of the military. and i've heard some of these bands over the years. they're incredible. 
															
																			    														  we're going to have a very, very elegant day. the 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special, very beautiful. and i think we're going to have massive crowds, because we have a movement. it's a movement like the world has never seen before. it's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. and even the polls, although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't, and that was a beautiful scene on november 8 as those states started to pour in, and we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. and those states are going to have a lot of jobs and they're going to have a lot of security, they're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. 
															
																			    														  and by the way, speaking of veterans, i appointed today the head secretary of the veterans administration, david shulkin. we'll do a news release in a little while and tell you about david. he's fantastic. he will do a truly great job. one of the commitments i've made is that we're going to straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. 
															
																			    														  our veterans have been treated horribly. they're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days. cases where they go in and they have a minor, early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. by the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. it's not going to happen. it's not going to happen. 
															
																			    														  so, david is going to do a fantastic job. we're going to be talking to a few people also to help david. and we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the veterans administration, like the cleveland clinic, like the mayo clinic, a few more that we have, and we're going to set up a group. 
															
																			    														  these are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. 
															
																			    														  and they're going to get together with their great doctors, dr. toby cosgrove, as you know, from the cleveland clinic, has been very involved. ike perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business.  
															
																			    														  and we're going to straighten out the va for our veterans. i've been promising that for a long time, and it's something i feel very, very strongly. so, you'll get the information on david, and i think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. we looked long and hard. we interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good, but we had a lot of talent, and we think this selection will be something that will, with time, with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good, because our veterans have been treated very unfairly. 
															
																			    														  okay, questions? yes, john. 
															
																			    														  reporter: mr. president-elect, thank you so much. 
															
																			    														  trump: thank you. 
															
																			    														  reporter: appreciate it. a couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on friday that we're looking for further clarification on. 
															
																			    														  trump: sure. 
															
																			    														  reporter: first of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with a two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? and secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that vladimir putin ordered the hack of the dnc and the attempted hack of the rnc? 
															
																			    														  and if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the united states? 
															
																			    														  trump: first of all, these meetings as you know are confidential, classified, so i'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting, but we have many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us.  
															
																			    														  and i will say, again, i think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. i saw the information. i read the information outside of that meeting. 
															
																			    														  it's all fake news. it's phony stuff. it didn't happen. and it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. it was a group of opponents that got together, sick people, and they put that crap together. 
															
																			    														  so, i will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. it should never have been â number one, shouldn't have even entered paper, but it should never have been released. 
															
																			    														  but i read what was released, and i think it's a disgrace. i think it's an absolute disgrace. as far as hacking, i think it was russia, but i think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. 
															
																			    														  and i can say that, you know, when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. that was something that was extraordinary that was probably china. 
															
																			    														  we have much hacking going on. and one of the things we're going to do â we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. 
															
																			    														  you saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world. they were never in the same room together as a group. and we're going to put those minds together and were going to form a defense. 
															
																			    														  and i have to say this also â the democratic national committee was totally open to be hacked. they did a very poor job. they could have had hacking defense, which we had. and i will give reince priebus credit, because when reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. and they tried to hack the republican national committee and they were unable to break through. we have to do that for our country. it's very important.  
															
																			    														  reporter: mr. president-elect â [inaudible question] 
															
																			    														  trump: well, you know, president putin and russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. they said it totally never happened. now, somebody would say, ""oh, of course he's going to say that."" i respected the fact that he said that. 
															
																			    														  and i'll be honest, i think if he did have something, they would have released it. they would have been glad to release it. i think, frankly, had they broken into the republican national committee, i think they would have released it just like they did about hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like mr. podesta, said about her. i mean, what he said about her was horrible. if somebody said about me what podesta said about hillary â i was the boss, i would have fired him immediately, or that person, because what he said about her was horrible. but remember this â we talk about the hacking, and hacking's bad, and it shouldn't be done, but look at the things that were hacked. look at what was learned from that hacking, that hillary clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? that's a horrible thing. that's a horrible thing. can you imagine that if donald trump got the questions to the debate, it would have been the biggest story in the history of stories, and they would have said immediately, ""you have to get out of the race."" nobody even talked about it. it's a very terrible thing.  
															
																			    														  reporter: mr. president-elect. thank you, mr. president-elect. on that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that vladimir putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. do you accept that part of the finding? and will you undo what president obama did to punish the russians for this if given a chance? 
															
																			    														  well, if putin likes donald trump, i consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with russia. russia can help us fight isis, which by the way is, number one, tricky. i mean, if you look, this administration created isis by leaving at the wrong time. the void was created, isis was formed. if putin likes donald trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset, not a liability. now, i don't know that i'm going to get along with vladimir putin. i hope i do. but there's a good chance i won't. and if i don't, do you honestly believe that hillary would be tougher on putin than me? does anybody in this room really believe that? give me a break. 
															
																			    														  reporter: can you make clear whether during your visits to either moscow or st. petersburg you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable â 
															
																			    														  no â 
															
																			    														  reporter: reasonable observers say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by russia or by its intelligence agencies. 
															
																			    														  let me just say what i do. when i leave our country â i'm a very high-profile person, would you say? i am extremely careful. i'm surrounded by bodyguards. i'm surrounded by people. 
															
																			    														  and i always tell them anywhere, but i always tell them, if i'm leaving this country, be very careful, because in your hotel rooms, and no matter where you go, you're going to probably have cameras. i'm not referring just to russia, but i would certainly put them in that category. and number one, i hope you're going to be good anyway. but in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places, cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. you'd better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television. i tell this to people all the time. i was in russia years ago with the miss universe contest, which did very well. moscow, the moscow area, did very, very well. and i told many people, be careful, because you don't want to see yourself on television. cameras all over the place. and again, not just russia, all over. does anyone really believe that story? i'm also very much of a germophobe, by the way, believe me. 
															
																			    														  reporter: how do you plan to disentangle yourself from your business? but first, i have to follow up on some of these russia remarks. based your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? does russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? and if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? 
															
																			    														  so, i tweeted out that i have no dealings with russia. i have no deals in russia. i have no deals that could happen in russia, because we've stayed away. and i have no loans with russia. as a real estate developer, i have very, very little debt. i have assets that are â and now people have found out how big the company is â i have very little debt, but i have no loans with russia at all. and i thought that was important to put out. i certified that. 
															
																			    														  so, i have no deals, i have no loans and i have no dealings. we could make deals in russia very easily if we wanted to. i just don't want to because i think that would be a conflict. so i have no loans, no dealings and no current pending deals. now, i have to say one other thing. over the weekend, i was offered $2 billion to do a deal in dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the middle east, hussein dumak (sp), a friend of mine, great guy, and was offered $2 billion to do a deal in dubai, a number of deals. and i turned it down. i didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, i have a no-conflict situation because i'm president, which is â i didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have, but i don't want to take advantage of something. i have something that others don't have. vice president pence also has it. i don't think he'll need it. i have a feeling he's not going to need it. but i have a no conflict of interest provision as president. it was many, many years old. this is for presidents because they don't want presidents getting â i understand, they don't want presidents getting tangled in minutiae. they want a president to run the country. so i could actually run my business. i could actually run my business and run government at the same time. i don't like the way that looks, but i would be able to do that, if i wanted to. i would be the only one that would be able to do that. you can't do that in any other capacity, but as a president, i could run the trump organization â great, great company â and i could run the country. i'd do a very good job. but i don't want to do that. now, all of these papers that you see here â yes, go ahead. 
															
																			    														  reporter: do you believe the hacking was justified and will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in russia? 
															
																			    														  well, i'm not releasing the tax returns, because as you know, they're under audit.  
															
																			    														  reporter: but every president since the '70s has â 
															
																			    														  gee, i've never heard that. i've never heard that before. you know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, ok? 
															
																			    														  reporter: you don't think the american public is concerned about that? 
															
																			    														  no, i don't think so. i won. i mean, i became president. no, i don't think they care at all. 
															
																			    														  i think you care. i think you care. first of all, you learn very little from a tax return. what you should do is go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. and actually, people have learned a lot about my company, and now they realize my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. we're in many, many countries and i'm very proud of it. and what i'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, don and eric, are going to be running the company. they are going to be running it in a very professional manner. they're not going to discuss it with me. again, i don't have to do this. they're not going to discuss it with me. and with that, i'm going to bring up sheri dillon, and she's going to go â these papers are just some of the many documents i've signed turning over complete and total control to my son. 
															
																			    														  [break as trump's attorney speaks about his business relations being turned over] 
															
																			    														  reporter: thank you mr. trump. american news. what is your response to your critics that say not only do you but also your cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest and do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your cabinet and everyone throughout your administration â 
															
																			    														  trump: great question. i really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening and why i was just watching, as an example, rex tillerson, i think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying. i watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator who is going to be a great attorney general, and he was brilliant. and what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in alabama, and he was brilliant yesterday. so i really think that they are â i think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together. and we've been hearing that from so many people. people are so happy. 
															
																			    														  you know, in the case of rex, he ran incredibly exxonmobil, when there was a find, he would get it. when they needed something, he would be there. a friend of mine who is very, very substantial in the oil business, harold hamm, big supporter, he said there's nobody in the business like rex tillerson. and that's what we want. that's what i want to bring to government. i want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. we don't make good deals anymore. i say it all the time in speeches. we don't make good deals anymore. we make bad deals. our trade deals are a disaster. we have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis. hundreds of billions with china on trade and trade imbalance, with japan, with mexico, with just about everybody. we don't make good deals anymore. so we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because, generally speaking, they're smart. and that's what i put. i'm very proud of the cabinet. i think they're doing very well. it's very interesting how it's going. but it's â i think they're doing very, very well. 
															
																			    														  reporter: thank you, mr. president-elect. i want to ask a few questions on obamacare. can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or a delay? 
															
																			    														  trump: finally, obamacare. 
															
																			    														  reporter: i want to ask you if you â 
															
																			    														  trump: uh-oh.
															
																			    														  reporter: â have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage to those who have gotten health insurance through the obamacare law? 
															
																			    														  trump: you will be very, very proud, not only as the media and reporters, but you're going to be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. obamacare is a complete and total disaster. they can say what they want. they can guide you any way they want to guide you. in some cases they guide you incorrectly. in most cases you realize what's happened. it's imploding as we sit. some states have over 100 percent increase. and '17 â i said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. it's going to be catastrophic. frankly, we could sit back â and it was a thought from a political standpoint â but it wouldn't be fair to the people. we could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a chuck schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come â they would come begging to us, please, we have to do something about obamacare. we don't want to own it. we don't want to own it, politically. 
															
																			    														  they own it right now. so the easiest thing would to be to let it implode in '17 and, believe me, we would get pretty much whatever we wanted but it would take a long time. we're going to be submitting as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. it will be repeal and replace. 
															
																			    														  it will be essentially simultaneously. it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. could be the same hour. so we're going to do repeal and replace. very complicated stuff. 
															
																			    														  and we're going to get a health bill passed. we're going to get health care taken care of in this country. you have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high. 
															
																			    														  obamacare is the democrats' problem. we're going to take the problem off the shelves for them. 
															
																			    														  we're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. we could sit back and let them hang with it. we are doing the democrats a great service. 
															
																			    														  so as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we will be filing a plan and it was actually pretty accurately reported today, the new york times, and the plan will be repeal and replace obamacare. we're going to have health care that is far less expensive and far better. ok. 
															
																			    														  reporter: sir. 
															
																			    														  staffer: which one, mr. president-elect? 
															
																			    														  trump: well, i was going right here. go ahead. then cbs. 
															
																			    														  reporter: president-elect trump, when you look at all the meetings you've had with carrier and softbank and alibaba,   do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce? and then my follow-up question, how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and cuts? 
															
																			    														  trump: well, if i could save jobs. for instance, i was doing individual companies and people said, ""well, that's only one company."" like, we did a good job with carrier and i want to thank you, united technologies, which owns carrier. but we saved close to a thousand jobs. and they were gone. and mike pence and his staff really helped us a lot. but those were â that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving. 
															
																			    														  it's always tough when they're building a plant, a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement. i want to thank united technologies. but we've been meeting with a lot of companies. 
															
																			    														  but what really is happening is the word is now out that when you want to move your plant to mexico or some other place and you want to fire all of your workers from michigan and ohio and all these places that i won, for good reason, not going to happen that way anymore.  
															
																			    														  you want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going build that plant in mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making and you're going to sell it through a, what will be a, very, very strong border, not a weak border like it is â we don't even have a border. it's an open sieve. you're going to sell through a very strong border. not going to happen. you're going to pay a very large border tax.  
															
																			    														  so if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great american workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from michigan to tennessee and to north carolina and south carolina, you can move from south carolina back to michigan, you can do anywhere, you've got a lot of states at play, lot of competition, so it's not like, oh, gee, i'm taking the competition. you've got a lot of places you can move. and i don't care as long as it's within the united states. the borders of united states.  
															
																			    														  there will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. and if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago and you'd have millions more workers right now in the united states, that are 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. you know that story. the real number. that's the real number. so that's the way it is. ok, go ahead. 
															
																			    														  reporter: a question about the supreme court and the border security, but i also want to ask you about something you said on twitter this morning: are we living in nazi germany? what were you driving at there? do you have a problem with the intelligence community? on the supreme court, what's your timeline? you said a while ago you were down to four. have you conducted those yet? what's your timeline for nominating? on the border fence, it now appears clear u.s. taxpayers will have to pay for it upfront. what is your plan to get mexico to pay for it? 
															
																			    														  trump: i got it. anything more? [crowd's laughter] 
															
																			    														  trump: on the fence. it's not a fence, it's a wall. you just misreported it. we're going to build a wall. i could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office. but i don't want to wait. mike pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through congress for the wall to begin. i don't feel like waiting a year or a year and a half. i'm going to start building. mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall.  
															
																			    														  that will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment. probably less likely that it's a payment. but it will happen. so remember this, ok, i would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. i would then say who is going to pay for the wall? and people would all scream out, 25, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like trump has had. you know that. you don't like to report that but that's ok. ok. now we agree. finally, he agrees.  
															
																			    														  but i say, ""who is going to pay for the wall?"" and they will scream out, ""mexico!"" now, reports went out last week, oh, mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. what's the difference? i want to get the wall started. i don't want to wait a year and a half until i make my deal with mexico. and we probably will have a deal sooner than that. by the way, mexico has been so nice, so nice. 
															
																			    														  i respect the government of mexico. i respect the people of mexico. i love the people of mexico. i have many people from mexico working for me. they are phenomenal people. the government of mexico is terrific. i don't blame them for what's happened. i don't blame them for taking advantage of the united states. 
															
																			    														  i wish our politicians were so smart. mexico has taken advantage of the united states. i don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of mexico. what i say is, we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. it's not going to happen anymore. so in order to get the wall started, mexico will pay for the wall. but it will be reimbursed. ok? 
															
																			    														  supreme court judge. so as you know, i have a list of 20. i've gone through them. we've met with numerous candidates. they're outstanding in every case. they were largely recommended and highly recommended by federalist society. jim demint was also very much involved in this group, which is fantastic and he is a fantastic guy so between leo and jim demint and some senators and some congress people, we have a great group of people. 
															
																			    														  i'll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the united states supreme court, a replacement for the great, great justice scalia. that will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. so within about two weeks probably the second week, i consider the first day because we'll also be doing some â some pretty good signings. and i think what we'll do is we'll wait until monday. 
															
																			    														  that will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on friday, because on friday people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration. and then saturday as you know we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. so our first day, and you will be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing pretty good signings on monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday and then also the next week. and you're all invited. 
															
																			    														  but on the supreme court, i'll be make that decision and it will be a decision which i very strongly believe in. i think it's one of the reasons i got elected. i think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the supreme court. so i think it was a very, very big decision as to why i was elected. 
															
																			    														  [ inaudible ] 
															
																			    														  i think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. i think it's a disgrace. and i say that and i say that. 
															
																			    														  and that's something that nazi germany would have done and did do. it's a disgrace. that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public, as far as buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, i think they're going to suffer the consequences. 
															
																			    														  they already are. and as far as cnn going out of their way to build it up â and by the way, we just found out, i was coming down, michael cohn is a very talented lawyer, good lawyer in my firm. was just reported that it wasn't this michael cohn were talking about. all night long, michael cohn. i want to see your passport. 
															
																			    														  he brings his passport to my office. i say, wait a minute, he didn't leave the country. he wasn't out of the country. they had michael cohn of the trump organization was in prague. it turned out to be a different michael cohn. it's a disgrace what took place. it's a disgrace and i think they ought to apologize to start with, michael cohn. 
															
																			    														  go ahead. go ahead. go ahead. no, not you. not you. your organization is terrible. your organization is terrible. let's go. go ahead. quiet. quiet. she's asking a question. don't be rude. don't be rude. don't be rude. no, i'm not going to give you a question. i'm not going to give you a question. you are fake news. go ahead. go ahead. 
															
																			    														  reporter: â with the sanctions that they put on russia after the hacking. 
															
																			    														  trump: i don't think he went too far.  
															
																			    														  reporter: what do you think of lindsey graham's plan for a bill to send you tougher ones? 
															
																			    														  trump: plans to send me a bill for what? 
															
																			    														  reporter: tougher sanctions. 
															
																			    														  trump: i haven't heard lindsey graham is going to do that. lindsey graham, i've been competing with him for a long time. he's going to crack that 1 percent barrier one day. i didn't realize lindsey graham was still at it. it's all right. i heard he's a nice guy actually. i've been hearing it. i've been hearing it. go ahead. yeah, go ahead. you've been waiting. 
															
																			    														  reporter: as far as we understand, the intelligence â 
															
																			    														  trump: stand up. 
															
																			    														  reporter: ian pannell from bbc news. 
															
																			    														  trump: another beauty.  
															
																			    														  reporter: thank you. as far as we understand it, intelligence community are still looking at the allegations. it's false news, as you describe it. if they come back with any kind of conclusion with any of it stands up, if any of it is true, will you consider your position, would you think â 
															
																			    														  trump: there's nothing they can come back. yes, yes, go ahead. go ahead.  
															
																			    														  reporter: can you â 
															
																			    														  trump: go ahead. 
															
																			    														  reporter:  â public state news and all the problems seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here?  
															
																			    														  trump: well, i don't recommend reforms. i recommend people that are â that have some moral compass. you know i've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and talking about people go and say all sorts of things. i will tell you some of the media outlets that i deal with are fake news. more so than anybody. i could name them, but i won't bother. you have a few sitting right in front of us. so they're very, very dishonest people. 
															
																			    														  but i think it's just something we're going to have to live with. i guess the advantage i have is that i can speak back. when it happens to somebody that doesn't have this, doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. it's a very sad thing. i've seen people destroyed. i've seen people absolutely destroyed and i think it's very unfair. so all i can ask for is honest reporters. yes. 
															
																			    														  reporter: i just want to follow up on the questions about the u.s. intelligence community and be very clear about what you're saying. do you trust your u.s. intelligence officials and what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you are actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? 
															
																			    														  trump: intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. we are going to put in mr. pompeo and others, you know the senator, dan coats, we're going to put in outstanding people. within 90 days they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. 
															
																			    														  i want them to cover this situation. i also want them, however, to cover maybe most importantly, because we're hacked by everybody. you know the united states, our government, out of a list of 17 in terms of industries, it's the worst, number 17 in terms of protection. 
															
																			    														  if you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries they put this in the category of an industry, the united states is last in terms of protecting, let's say hacking defense. like we had a great hacking defense at the republican national committee. that's why we weren't hacked. by the way, we were told they were trying to hack us but they weren't able to hack. 
															
																			    														  i think i get some credit because i told reince and reince did a phenomenal job. but i said i want a hacking defense. the democratic national committee did not do that. wait, wait, wait. let me finish. within 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense. 
															
																			    														  how do we stop this new phenomena, fairly new phenomena, because the united states is hacked by everybody. that includes russia and china and everybody. everybody. ok. go ahead. go ahead. 
															
																			    														  reporter: you said just now that you believe that russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the dnc and john podesta's e-mail, etcetera.  
															
																			    														  trump: but you know what, it could have been others also.  
															
																			    														  reporter: why did you spend weeks undermining u.s. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement. 
															
																			    														  trump: i think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. i think it's pretty sad. first of all, it's illegal. you know, these are â these are classified and certified meetings and reports. i'll tell you what does happen. i have many meetings with intelligence. and every time i meet people are reading about it. somebody is leaking it out. so there's â maybe it's my office. maybe my office. 
															
																			    														  because i have a lot of people, a lot of great people. maybe it's them. and what i did is i said, i won't tell anybody. i'm going to have the meeting. and i won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. and what happened is i had my meeting. nobody knew. not even rhona, my executive assistant for years. 
															
																			    														  she didn't know. i didn't tell her. nobody knew. the meeting was had. the meeting was over. they left. and immediately the word got out that i had a meeting. so i don't want that. i don't want that. it's very unfair to the country. it's very unfair to our country what's happened. that report should have never â first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. i thank the new york times for saying that. i thank a lot of different people for saying that. but i will tell you that should never ever happen. ok.
															
																			    														  reporter: thank you, mr.president-elect. can you stand here today once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign and, if you indeed do believe that russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to vladimir putin right now? 
															
																			    														  trump: he shouldn't be doing it. he won't be doing it. russia will have much greater respect for our country when i'm leading it than when other people have led it. you will see that. russia will respect our country more. he shouldn't have done it. i don't believe he will be doing it more now. we have to work something out. but it's not just russia. 
															
																			    														  take look at what's happened. you don't report it the same way. twenty-two million accounts were hacked in this country by china. and that's because we have no defense. that's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing. russia will have far greater respect for our country when i'm leading it. and i believe â and i hope, maybe it won't happen, it's possible, but i won't be given a little reset button like hillary. 
															
																			    														  press this piece of plastic. the guy looked at her like, what is she doing? there's no reset button. we're either going to get along or we're not. i hope we get along. but if not, that's possible, too. but russia and other countries and other countries including china, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the south china sea by building their massive fortress, total. russia, china, japan, mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. 
															
																			    														  i want to thank everybody. so this is all â just so you understand, these papers, because i'm not sure that was explained properly. these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons and i hope at the end of eight years i'll come back and i'll say, ""oh, you did a good job."" otherwise, if they do a bad job, i'll say, you're fired. goodbye, everybody. goodbye. 
															
																			    																     
																		an estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between white house contenders hillary clinton and donald trump on tv on wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.
															
																			    														the data supplied by the nielsen ratings agency on thursday covered people who watched wednesday night's debate on the four main u.s. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels.
															
																			    														the first clinton-trump face-off in september attracted a total tv audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of u.s. presidential debates.
															
																						
												    														last week's second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular ""sunday night football,"" was seen by 66.5 million.
															
																			    																 
																		  wednesday's audience ranked as the third-highest for a u.s. presidential debate since nielsen started collecting tv viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. a 1980 debate between democratic president jimmy carter and republican challenger ronald reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. 
															
																			    														  nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on tv at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. 
															
																			    														  the third debate ahead of the nov. 8 election was marked by trump's refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the republican candidate loses to his democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of american democracy. 
															
																			    														  the presidential election debate, held in las vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from fox news, chris wallace. it gave fox news cable channel the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters abc and nbc with more than 10 million viewers each. 
															
																			    														  second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller tv audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year. 
															
																			    																  
																		  it's hard to fathom one issue on which both donald trump and hillary clinton agree, but trade agreements have become the piãâ±ata of choice for beating by both parties in the 2016 presidential race.   
															
																			    														  both campaigns have tapped into voter anger over u.s. job losses and have placed blame solely on our ""evil"" trade partners.  the most recent swipe was a memo released by the trump camp discussing job losses in pennsylvania which they attributed to nafta and the south korea trade agreement.  
															
																			    														  the numbers are packaged to be as scary as possible to voters, but any economist will tell you that statistics can be used to spin many different compelling stories. and there is more than one factor at work here. 
															
																						
												    														  jobs in u.s. manufacturing have been declining since long before nafta or the south korea agreement. as china, india, and other developing nations started to grow and became more competitive, we started losing ground in certain sectors.  
															
																			    														  however, even the sectors which did not suffer production losses, showed a decrease in their employment. the major factor behind this is technology. as we adopt technology throughout the production process (some prefer the word ""automation""), the demand for labor in some sectors goes down. look no further than your neighborhood retail stores, where checkout counters are being replaced one-by-one with self-checkout options. 
															
																			    														  in fact, the 2016 economic report of the president has a special section on the possible effects of automation on workers. their calculations indicate that lower wage jobs, such as those paying less than 20 dollars per hour, are more likely to be automated (with a probability of automation of more than 80 percent). 
															
																			    																 
																		  whether or not there is trade, experts expect this automation process to pick up pace. however, you do not hear either of the candidates discussing this trend, maybe because it is not juicy enough. 
															
																			    														  furthermore, there is one important gain from trade that everyone in politics loves to ignore: lower prices for consumers. it is probably easy to ignore this important impact since the gains to each individual from trade are relatively small compared to someone who loses his or her job and livelihood.  but they add up.  
															
																			    														  many of us enjoy the increased product variety and lower prices without noticing that it could be the result of free trade. a 2014 study by fajgelbaum and khandelwal notes that a large share of this price benefit accrues to lower income consumers, since they spend a larger share of their disposable income on heavily traded food and clothing items.  
															
																			    														  they estimate that consumers in the bottom 10th percentile of the income distribution would lose more than half of their purchasing power if u.s. pulled out from international trade. it is interesting that this fact is not part of the discussion when there is an increasing focus on growing income inequality in u.s. politics. 
															
																			    														  it is vital to evaluate trade agreements not only based on the losses, but also on gains whether they accrue to exporting industries or consumers. most economists agree that the benefits from free trade outweigh any resulting job loss and that appropriate domestic policies such as trade adjustment assistance can help shore up any domestic labor impact.  
															
																			    														  this could take various forms such as retraining workers for other booming industries or financial assistance.   in addition, as trade agreements were adopted, overall job growth in the u.s. has trended upward over time, only slipping back during recessions. furthermore, total u.s. manufacturing output has increased in recent decades even though it employs fewer workers. 
															
																			    														  rather than pointing our fingers at foreigners for the sad state of our economy and blaming trade, maybe it is time to ask where did we go wrong? the list is not short: our outdated tax code, increasing regulatory burden, crumbling infrastructure, and deteriorating education system are just a few culprits that have contributed to our sluggish economy and slow job growth. 
															
																			    														  our decreasing competitiveness in the international arena is most likely due to not keeping up with an evolving global economy. to address these major issues, we need strong leadership that is willing to break the growing partisanship in the congress and make tough decisions. kicking the can down the road will become harder and harder as the cost of inaction balloons. 
															
																			    														  whether or not there is a vote on the trans pacific partnership (tpp) during the lame duck session is still uncertain. both presidential candidates have voiced their opposition to the agreement and that is shortsighted. despite the noise made by trade opponents, 60 percent of americans supports the passage of tpp, according to the chicago council on global affairs.  
															
																			    														  we can continue lowering the trade piãâ±ata for everyone to whack and claim that ""we cannot compete."" or we can reach for the higher goal, put our fiscal house in order, approve tpp, and lead the pack in asia, the fastest growing region of the world.

																		  there isn't a ""chorus"" behind donald trump's debate performance, and that could have reverberations on the gop's congressional races, experts told cnbc's ""squawk alley"" on thursday. 
															
																			    														  trump was doing ""fairly well"" in a focus group with undecided voters until a few key moments of the debate, said chris kofinis, ceo of park street strategies, a public relations and research firm. he said that trump's remark that clinton was a ""nasty woman,"" and his comments about accepting the outcome of the election, represent a ""blown opportunity"" for the republican nominee. 
															
																			    														  ""people kind of turned on him,"" said kofinis, who previously worked for a democrat, sen. joe manchin. ""it really kind of speaks to the larger problem that trump has had with his entire campaign. he keeps blaming everyone else for his faults, for the flaws."" 
															
																						
												    																 
																		  when asked if he would commit to accepting the result of the race, regardless of outcome, trump responded, ""i will look at it at the time,"" reaffirming his previous comments that the election is ""rigged.""  
															
																			    														  ""what i'm saying is that i will tell you at the time. i'll keep you in suspense,"" trump said during the final debate at the university of nevada, las vegas, on wednesday.  
															
																			    														  kofinis said that trump's leadership may ""bleed down"" to the congressional election, and that there is ""unquestionably"" political damage within the republican party. there is ""enormous soul searching"" in the party right now, said sara fagen, cnbc contributor and former bush-cheney campaign strategist.  
															
																			    														  forty house seats are open to newcomers this year, and more than half are considered ""safe"" for the current party.  
															
																			    														  ""i think if we lose the house of representatives, it's going to be a referendum on the type of campaign donald trump ran,"" fagen said. ""i'm not saying we're going to lose the house â i think there's a decent chance, and a good chance, that paul ryan will remain speaker, albeit by a smaller majority. but if we do lose the house, it won't be because of anything that paul ryan did.""  
															
																			    														  â cnbc's christine wang and john schoen contributed to this report. 
															
																			    																    very few people thought he would actually run, then he did. they thought he wouldn't climb in the polls, then he did. they said he wouldn't win any primaries, then he did. they said he wouldn't win the republican nomination, then he did. finally, they said there was no way he could compete for, let alone win, a general election. now he's president-elect trump. here are five ways he pulled off what was unexpected by most and incomprehensible to many.  toss-ups were tossed aside. one after another, ohio, florida and north carolina went to mr trump.  that left mrs clinton's blue firewall, and the firewall was eventually breached. the democrat's last stand largely rested on her strength in the midwest. those were states that had gone democrat for decades, based in part on the support of black and working-class white voters.  those working-class white people, particularly ones without college education - men and women - deserted the party in droves. rural voters turned out in high numbers, as the americans who felt overlooked by the establishment and left behind by the coastal elite made their voices heard. while places like virginia and colorado held fast, wisconsin fell - and with it mrs clinton's presidential hopes.   when all is said and done, mrs clinton may end up winning the popular vote on the back of strong support in places like california and new york and closer-than-expected losses in solid-red states like utah.  the trump wave hit in the places it had to, however. and it hit hard. mr trump insulted decorated war veteran john mccain.  he picked a fight with fox news and its popular presenter, megyn kelly.  he doubled down when asked how he once mocked the weight of a hispanic beauty pageant winner.  he offered a half-hearted apology when the secret video surfaced of his boasting about making unwanted sexual advances towards women. he gaffed his way through the three presidential debates with clearly lightly practised performances. none of it mattered. while he took dips in the polls following some of the more outrageous incidents, his approval was like a cork - eventually bouncing back to the surface.  perhaps the various controversies came so hard and fast that none had time to draw blood. maybe mr trump's personality and appeal was so strong, the scandals just bounced off. whatever the reason, he was bulletproof.  he ran against the democrats. he also ran against the powers within his own party. he beat them all.  mr trump built a throne of skulls out of his republican primary opponents. some, like marco rubio, ted cruz, chris christie and ben carson, eventually bent knee. the holdouts, like jeb bush and ohio governor john kasich, are now on the outside of their party looking in. and for the rest of the party insiders, from house speaker paul ryan on down? mr trump didn't need their help - and, in fact, may have won because he was willing to take a stand against them.  mr trump's pox-on-them-all attitude is likely to have proved his independence and outsider status at a time when much of the american public reviled washington (although not enough to keep them from re-electing most congressional incumbents running for re-election). it was a mood some other national politicians sensed - democrat bernie sanders, for instance, as well as mr cruz. no one, however, captured it more than trump, and it won him the white house.  the polls clearly did a woeful job predicting the shape and preferences of the electorate, particularly in midwestern states. in the final days of the campaign, however, the reality is that the polls were close enough that mr trump had a pathway to victory. that pathway didn't look nearly as obvious about two weeks ago, before fbi director james comey released his letter announcing that they were reopening their investigation into hillary clinton's private email server. true, the polls were tightening a bit, but mr trump's sharpest rise in the standings came in the weeks between that first letter and mr comey's second, in which he said he had put the investigation back on the shelf. it seems likely that during that period, mr trump was able to successfully consolidate his base, bringing wayward conservatives back into the fold and shredding mrs clinton's hopes of offering a compelling closing message to us voters. of course, mr comey's actions never would have been a factor if mrs clinton had decided to rely on state department email servers for her work correspondence. that one is on her shoulders. mr trump ran the most unconventional of political campaigns, but it turned out he knew better than all the experts.  he spent more on hats than on pollsters. he travelled to states like wisconsin and michigan that pundits said were out of reach.  he held massive rallies instead of focusing on door-knocking and get-out-the-vote operations.  he had a disjointed, sometimes chaotic national political convention that was capped by an acceptance speech that was more doom-and-gloom than any in modern us political history. he was vastly outspent by the clinton campaign, just as he was during the republican primaries. he turned consensus wisdom about how to win the presidency on its head.  all of these decisions - and many more - were roundly ridiculed in ""knowledgeable"" circles.  in the end, however, they worked. mr trump and his closest confidants - his children and a few chosen advisers - will have the last laugh. and they'll do it from the white house.   mr trump has been hugely critical of nato (the north atlantic treaty organization), a cornerstone of american foreign policy for more than 60 years. he has attacked the organisation as obsolete and characterised its members as ungrateful allies who benefit from us largesse. he says america can no longer afford to protect countries in europe - and in asia - without adequate compensation, suggesting he would withdraw american forces unless they pay up. in one sense, he is simply voicing longstanding us concerns about most nato members not meeting their goal of spending at least 2% of gdp on defence, while us defence spending is the largest in the world. he also stressed in a presidential debate he was ""all for nato"". but his stance has sparked alarm, particularly in eastern europe which sees the alliance as a bulwark against russia. as for russia itself, mr trump has said he believes he can ease tensions with president vladimir putin, and has praised him as a strong leader with whom he would love to have a good relationship.  barack obama began his presidency calling for a ""reset"" with one of the us' long-term rivals. since then russia-us ties have been strained, no more so than over the two countries backing rival sides in syria's civil war. mr trump has said little about what better relations might involve beyond a desire for a joint fight against the militants of so-called islamic state.  but he intends to find out if the russians would be ""reasonable"", confident that he could better command mr putin's respect than hillary clinton or president obama. donald trump's trade policies would amount to the single biggest change to the way america does business with the rest of the world in decades.  he has threatened to scrap a number of existing free trade agreements, including the north american free trade agreement between the us, canada and mexico, which he blames for job losses. he has even suggested withdrawing the us from the world trade organization.  he is also in favour of taxing imports, and has talked about imposing tariffs of 45% on china and 35% on goods shipped from mexico, in an effort to prevent companies moving jobs south of the border.  for president obama, the deal that saw sanctions against iran lifted in exchange for guarantees it would not pursue nuclear weapons was a ""historic understanding"". but for donald trump, echoing republican concerns, it was ""the worst deal i think i've ever seen negotiated"". he has said dismantling it would be his ""number one priority"". doing so would potentially have a huge impact on the middle east, with iran a key player in the syrian conflict and a rival of saudi arabia and israel, for instance. already iran's foreign minister javad zarif has urged trump to stay committed to the nuclear deal. he suggested the us would have to respect the accord given that it was thrashed out with several world powers. a donald trump presidency raises major security questions in asia. china is largely thought to welcome a donald trump presidency, perhaps anticipating a more isolationist us foreign policy. japan and south korea have both been singled out by mr trump for relying too much on the us. he has even said they would benefit from having their own nuclear arsenals. then there is the region's renegade state, north korea, which is currently developing its own nuclear weapons. mr trump faces the task of curbing those ambitions, something that has eluded successive us leaders.  how he might do this is unclear - in the past year mr trump has both called north korean leader kim jong-un a ""bad dude"" but also said he would directly negotiate with him.  either way, us politics' most unpredictable presidential candidate tackling the world's most unpredictable state makes north korea a likely flashpoint in the coming years. president-elect trump has said that he will ""cancel"" the paris climate agreement within 100 days of taking office and will do everything in his power to reverse climate change regulations introduced by president obama.  he has pledged to stop all government funding of clean energy projects and climate change initiatives. mr trump has repeatedly denied the science of human-caused climate change, describing it as ""fictional' and arguing that it is a hoax created by the chinese to make us manufacturing less competitive.   climate change: nations will push ahead with plans despite trump but while there are ""legal and procedural roadblocks"" which would inhibit mr trump from a complete overhaul of us climate policy, the new york times says, the us remains legally bound to the paris plan for four years. but, the paper says, mr trump ""could significantly weaken or slow them down"". critics say his stance could cause other reluctant governments sceptical about the issue to reduce their efforts to cut planet-warming emissions. the president-elect's plans to renege on the paris agreement, his disdain for president obama's  clean power plan and his determination to push forward with coal have been condemned by green groups globally. but fossil fuel supporters say mr trump's plans prioritise the needs of american families by delivering them affordable energy in addition to invigorating the economy and creating more opportunities for future generations.   now that he has won the presidency, what has he promised - and can he deliver? where the next president stands on key issues pledge: start process of ""removing the more than two million criminal, illegal immigrants"" can it be done? it might be difficult, mainly because there are only an estimated 178,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records currently in the us. even if there were two million, beginning a mass deportation on that scale would be hard. however, he could start to recruit and train the thousands of extra people needed to enact such a deportation - although it is not immediately clear how he would afford the billions some have suggested it would cost. pledge: build a wall dividing the us and mexico can it be done? perhaps the most famous, or infamous, or mr trump's ideas, the president-elect says he wants to begin implementing plans for the construction of a ""beautiful"" wall along the southern us border immediately. beginning it will be one thing though, finishing another. tightening border security and building on us territory is well within his mandate, but details on the cost and practicalities of the scheme are yet to be worked out. mr trump insists the mexicans will foot the bill. how realistic is donald trump's wall? pledge: denying visa-free travel to countries who refuse to take back their citizens can it be done? in theory he can, under section 212(f) of the immigration and nationality act of 1952. in fact, president barack obama has used the act to block visas for certain groups. but he restricted it to very specific groups, like people under un travel bans and those helping the syrian government commit human rights abuses, and it has never been applied to entire countries. pledge: take action to appoint a new supreme court judge can it be done? there is a vacancy in the top us court after the death of conservative antonin scalia. president obama has nominated a replacement but the republican-controlled senate has refused to consider it. mr trump will now be able to fill mr scalia's seat, tipping the balance towards conservative-leaning officials. what's more, with others on the panel aged over 70, he could get to make further appointments should they die, influencing decisions on everything from abortion to freedom of the press for years to come. pledge: repealing every obama executive order can it be done? yes. his vow to overturn the executive orders would be within his powers bequeathed by the office. president obama made 32 executive orders during his time in office, including one lifting the remaining sanctions on myanmar (burma). his most wide-reaching and controversial one was probably his plan to lift the threat of deportation to millions of undocumented migrants and give them the right to work. that faced legal challenges and is now set to be reversed. pledge: scrapping obamacare can it be done? mr trump has called president obama's healthcare reforms a disaster and says he will ask congress to repeal them on day one of his term. senior republicans share mr trump's view and the party now controls both houses. despite this, repealing obamacare will be difficult, with mr trump having to find a way to overcome a democrat filibuster in the senate, scrap thousands of pages of associated regulations, and not least tackle what will replace it for the millions of america now receiving affordable care. pledge: restrictions on white house officials becoming lobbyists can it be done? in theory he would need the support of congress, which some have suggested is unlikely considering its impact on members' future earning potential. pledge: term limits for members of congress can it be done? this idea was first tabled back in 1994 by the gop and still hasn't come to fruition. whether mr trump can do it remains to be seen. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said soon after mr trump's election: ""i would say we have term limits now - they're called elections"". pledge: cancellation of all payments to un climate change programmes can it be done? mr trump has widespread support for scrapping the payment to the green climate fund among his republican colleagues - who have retained control of both houses - so he won't face much opposition should he choose to repeal it. his distrust of the paris agreement is also shared with many republicans. but the deal has been ratified so it's now international law, and would take him four years to withdraw from it. pledge: using that money to fix us infrastructure can it be done? putting money into infrastructure has been a popular campaign pledge for both mr trump and hillary clinton. but mr trump will need every cent he can find to fund the $1tn (£800bn) plan he unveiled in the last days of the campaign. pledge: cut taxes can it be done? mr trump's promise is traditional republican territory and is likely to appeal to even the most anti-trump party members in congress. the major question is whether mr trump can get along with the republican party's leaders. conciliatory gestures have been made, though -  house of representatives speaker paul ryan, who distanced himself from mr trump during the campaign, now says ""we will work hand-in-hand on a positive agenda to tackle this country's big challenges"". generally, presidents submit their first budgets in february. pledge: to label china a currency manipulator can it be done? mr trump could sign an executive order labelling the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. however, it is likely it would have little impact, beyond annoying china.   with the long campaign dominated by questions about his character, what he might do with power has become something of a sideshow.  but he will soon have the chance to shape us domestic and foreign policy. here is how he stands on key issues. mr trump has promised the biggest tax cuts since the ronald reagan era. he has pledged reductions across-the-board, promising working and middle income americans ""massive"" cuts. his plan includes reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three, cutting corporate taxes, eliminating the estate tax and increasing the standard deduction for individual filers.  according to one analysis, the top 1% of earners would see their income increase by double-digits, while the bottom quarter gets a boost of up to 1.9%. but the center for a responsible budget has also warned his plan would balloon the national debt. mr trump says he will create 25 million jobs over 10 years, saying too many jobs, especially in manufacturing, are being lost to other countries.  he plans to reduce the us corporate tax rate to 15% from the current rate of 35%, and suggests that investing in infrastructure, cutting the trade deficit, lowering taxes and removing regulations will boost job creation. this is his signature issue. despite critics who call it unaffordable and unrealistic, the republican has stood by his call to build an impenetrable wall along the 2,000-plus-mile us-mexico border. he has also called for reductions in legal immigration, ending president barack obama's executive actions deferring deportation proceedings for undocumented migrants, and more stringent efforts to reduce the number of these migrants living in the us. the candidate has backed away from earlier calls for the forced deportation of the more than 11 million undocumented migrants living on us soil and temporarily closing the us border to all muslims - but not dropped them. how do republicans think trump's wall would work? how would trump deport 11m from the us?  mr trump has been warning that the us policy of admitting refugees from certain regions - the middle east or, more generally, muslim nations - presents a serious threat to us national security. he has attempted to bolster his case by citing often debunked internet rumours, such as that syrian refugees are largely young, single men. he has called for the us to suspend resettling refugees until ""extreme vetting"" procedures can be implemented, including ideological tests to screen out extremists. he asserts that nations in the middle east - which have already received millions of syrian and iraqi refugees - must do more to create safe zones for those fleeing the violence. mr trump has criticised the iraq war (although his claims that he opposed it from the start are unfounded) and other us military action in the middle east. he has called for closer relations with vladimir putin's russia and says the us must make allies in europe and asia shoulder a greater share of the expense for their national defence and emphasises that us foreign policy must always prioritise american interests.  on the other hand, mr trump has also taken a hard-line stance toward combating is and has even at times asserted the us should commit tens of thousands of ground troops to the fight. he says nato should do more to combat terrorism in the middle east, maintaining that the us foots too much of the bill for the alliance and that other allies should spend more on their own protection. once upon a time, republicans were the party of unfettered free trade. donald trump has changed all that. while he says he is not opposed to trade in principle, any trade deals have to protect us industry. he is firmly against the trans-pacific partnership and has said that he will re-open negotiations on already signed pacts, such as the north america free trade agreement (nafta), and withdraw if us demands are not met. he has accused us trading partners like mexico and china of unfair trade practices, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft, threatening to unilaterally impose tariffs and other punitive measures if they do not implement reforms.  mr trump has issued no position statements on environmental issues on his website. in speeches and debates, however, he has said he opposes what he views as economically damaging environmental regulations backed by ""political activists with extreme agendas"".  he says he supports clean water and air, but wants to slash funding to the environmental protection agency. he has also called man-made climate change ""a hoax"" and said he would ""cancel"" the paris agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. the republican said in march that abortions should be illegal and he supported ""some form of punishment"" for women who had them. his campaign quickly backed down from that statement, however, and asserted that the candidate believed the legality of the procedure should be left up to individual states, with any criminal penalties being reserved for abortion providers.  he has said he supports an abortion ban exception for ""rape, incest and the life of the mother"". he has called for defunding planned parenthood. as recently as 2000, mr trump supported abortion rights but has said that, like ronald reagan, he changed his views on the matter. obamacare is one of the outgoing president's signature policies - and mr trump has vowed to repeal it. his alternative would give individual states greater control over their health plans, and allow more competition across state lines. with republicans in command of congress, revoking obamacare seems a real possibility. but they could face a backlash from the millions of americans losing coverage. violence and lawlessness is out of control in the us, according to mr trump. he says law enforcement agencies are unable to fight crime because of runaway ""political correctness"" and says they should be allowed to get tough on offenders. he says police profiling is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks on us soil.  he supports ""stop and frisk"", claiming the policy was highly successful in new york, even though many experts disagree. the practice was ruled unconstitutional and a form of ""indirect racial profiling"" by a federal judge in the city. rejecting republican orthodoxy, mr trump has called for six weeks of paid maternity leave, which would amount to what the mother would receive in unemployment benefit. but this would not apply to fathers. there are no details though on how this policy would be paid for. he has blamed some shootings on lax gun laws, saying armed people could have intervened and saved lives. he frequently accused rival hillary clinton of wanting to eliminate gun rights during the campaign and promises his supporters that the second amendment would be safe. one of the most important decisions for the next president is shaping the future of the supreme court. there is currently one vacancy, but with several justices of retirement age, mr trump could have more than one appointment to make, shifting the court to the right for years to come. mr trump wants to create restrictions on lobbyists, by first defining who is a ""lobbyist"". currently, anyone spending less than 20% of their time engaged in lobbying can call themselves an ""adviser"" or ""consultant"". mr trump says this is a loophole that must be closed. he also proposes there be a five-year ban preventing government officials who have recently departed the government from immediately joining lobbying firms.  he also wants a lifetime lobbying ban on any former administration officials who have previously worked on behalf of foreign governments. he has called on congress to change campaign finance laws to stop anyone who lobbies for foreign governments from raising funds for us elections. he has claimed to be ""self-funding"" his campaign, but has also employed a former hedge fund manager to solicit campaign funds from deep-pocket donors.   as news of the result was confirmed, they began to send congratulations - some fulsome, some more tentative - to the business mogul.   president vladimir putin has said he is willing fully to restore ties with the us following mr trump's victory. ""we heard the campaign statements of the future us presidential candidate about the restoration of relations between russia and the united states,"" mr putin said on wednesday. ""it is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return russian and american relations to a stable path of development. ""this would be good for both the russian and american people and have a positive impact on the climate of world affairs."" in moscow meanwhile senior nationalist mp vladimir zhirinovsky threw a party at the parliament building to celebrate mr trump's win. former soviet mikhail gorbachev has also welcomed his triumph. relations between the us and russia have become more tense because of the conflicts in ukraine and syria and allegations of russian cyber attacks in the us during the presidential campaign. chinese president xi jinping congratulated donald trump in a telegram, state tv reported. earlier the foreign ministry said that china was hoping to work with the new us government to boost bilateral relations.  ""us china trade relations are mutually beneficial. two mature big powers like the us and china will handle things well,"" foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said. ""we look forward to working together with the new us administration to push forward consistent, healthy and stable china-us relations which could be beneficial to the people of the two countries and to the world."" president hassan rouhani said the result would not have any impact on iran's policies. he was quoted by state media as saying the election result reflected internal discontent and instability within the us which would take a long time to be solved.  speaking in relation to the iran nuclear deal, president rouhani asserted that it was a clever move by the iranian government to establish it as a un security council resolution rather than a deal with a single government.  earlier foreign minister mohammad javad zarif was quoted by the official irna news agency as saying that the new us president should stick by the deal. ""iran and america have no political relations, but it is important that the future us president realises his duty to uphold the multilateral obligations of the joint comprehensive plan of action, and we expect the international community to require this of the united states of america,"" he said. prime minister haider al-abadi congratulated mr trump, saying he's looking forward to america's continued support in his country's fight against islamic state (is).  mr abadi said he hopes the ""world and the united states will continue to support iraq in fighting terrorism"". mr trump's future policy in the middle east remains unclear. president ashraf ghani said that his country and the us are ""strategic partners in the fight against terrorism and partners in development"".  ""[the] afghan government is hopeful that close co-operation [with] the new president-elect will further deepen ties between the two countries,"" a statement released by the presidential palace said.  chief executive abdullah abdullah added that ""combating extremism and efforts to bring peace and stability"" are the top priorities of both countries, along with strengthening economic, military, social and cultural ties. prime minister justin trudeau says that ""canada has no closer friend, partner and ally than the united states"".  ""we look forward to working very closely with president-elect trump, his administration, and with the united states congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security,"" he says. conspicuously, president enrique pena nieto does not congratulate mr trump on his victory. instead, he congratulates the us ""for its electoral process"" and tells the president-elect that he hopes the two countries will work together to form a stronger relationship. the foreign ministry congratulated donald trump on his win, adding that they hoped the new chapter would be marked by ""respect for non-intervention in internal affairs"". president nicolas maduro has repeatedly accused washington of trying to overthrow the south american country's government, a charge that has been rejected by state department representatives. the two countries continue to engage in trade despite not having embassies in their respective capitals since 2010.  in her message of congratulations, prime minister theresa may  focused on the ""special relationship"" between the two countries. she said that she hoped that mr trump's win would mean a continuation of shared values, including ""freedom, democracy and enterprise"". ""we are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence,"" she said.  ""i look forward to working with president-elect donald trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead."" president francois hollande said mr trump's victory ""opens a period of uncertainty"".   speaking in a televised address, he said that there was now a greater need for a united europe, able to wield influence on the international stage and promote its values and interests whenever they are challenged.  ""the us is an old and venerable democracy,"" chancellor angela merkel said. ""i watched the election result with particular suspense. someone elected to be president by the american people in free and fair elections has importance far beyond the usa.  ""for us germans, other than with the european union, we have no deeper connection than with the united states of america."" president milos zeman said mr trump's election was a victory over ""media manipulation"" as he congratulated the new us president. ""i would like to cordially congratulate donald trump. i had, as one of few european politicians, declared public support for this candidate... because i agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against islamic terrorism,"" zeman told reporters in a rare press briefing at the prague castle. ""i appreciate donald trump's public demeanour, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness."" prime minister narendra modi in tweets said: ""we look forward to working with you closely to take india-us bilateral ties to a new height,"" he said.  prime minister shinzo abe pledged a continuing close relationship between the us and japan in his congratulatory message.  ""i express my heartfelt congratulations on your election as the next president of the united states,"" his statement said. ""japan and the united states are unshakeable allies connected by common values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights and rule of law."" president recep tayyip erdogan said on wednesday he hoped mr trump's victory would lead to positive steps for the middle east and more freedom in the world. he called mr trump to congratulate him and the pair spoke about cooperation on issues including fighting terrorism, the turkish presidency said. ""i hope that this choice of the american people will lead to beneficial steps being taken for the world concerning basic rights and freedoms, democracy and developments in our region,"" mr erdogan said in a speech in istanbul. prime minister binali yildirim has wasted no time in urging the president-elect to extradite exiled us-based turkish cleric fethullah gulen, who is blamed for orchestrating a coup attempt earlier this year, a charge he denies. ""if you extradite in a short time the head of a terror organisation who has damaged our historic friendship, i am sure that you can give turkish-us relations a new start and open a new page,"" he said. president mahmoud abbas congratulated mr trump in a statement, expressing hope that ""peace will be achieved during his term"".  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said he hoped to reach ""new heights"" in relations with mr trump, who he described as ""a true friend of the state of israel"". ""i look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,"" he said. earlier hard line jewish home party leader and education minister naftali bennett said the notion of a palestinian state was over after donald trump's win.  ""trump's victory is an opportunity for israel to immediately retract the notion of a palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause,"" he said.  ""this is the position of the president-elect... the era of a palestinian state is over."" president ellen johnson sirleaf tells the bbc that she is ""extremely saddened"" by donald trump's victory.  ""our concern is whether president-elect trump will have an african agenda and build bridges,"" she said. ""we can only hope that he will do so in due course.""  the president said that she was worried about the future of trade deals between the us and liberia in particular and africa in general. ""we do not know what his policy towards africa will be,"" she said. ""obviously we are concerned but we will have to give him the benefit of the doubt.""  finland, sweden, denmark and norway may have had concerns about the new president, but were hopeful their close relations with the us would continue. ""let's give donald trump the benefit of the doubt,"" denmark's prime minister lars loekke rasmussen said, as he urged the us not to ""close in"" on itself. any surprise was met with a shrug by finnish prime minister juha sipila, a self-made millionaire, who pointed out the polls ""got it pretty badly wrong about brexit as well"".  he said that us relations for finland, which shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with russia, are of ""paramount"" importance and that trump's victory wouldn't mean a change in the non-aligned county's defence policy, its close ties to nato or finnish-russian relations.  meanwhile, norway's prime minister erna solberg congratulated donald trump, and swedish prime minister stefan lofven said many swedes were concerned about the election result, but that they had been ""prepared"" for it. polish president andrzej duda congratulated mr trump in a letter, and said: ""we are particularly pleased that during this year's nato summit in warsaw the us decided to increase its military presence in poland, thereby strengthening the alliance's eastern flank.  ""we sincerely hope that your leadership will open new opportunities for our co-operation based on mutual commitment."" president daniel ortega - who won his third term as leader on sunday - said he believed ""it is possible to work with the united states"" on the world's problems ""giving priority to peace"" as he congratulated mr trump. un secretary general ban ki-moon said that ""in the aftermath of a hard-fought and often divisive campaign, it is worth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the united states is one of the country's greatest strengths"".   ""i encourage all americans to stay true to that spirit. today's global challenges demand concerted global action and joint solutions.  as a founding member of the united nations and permanent member of the security council, the united states is an essential actor across the international agenda,"" he said. mr ban added that ""people everywhere look to the united states to use its remarkable power to help lift humanity up and to work for the common good"" which included the battle against climate change, advancing human rights and ""promoting mutual understanding... to achieve lives of peace, prosperity and dignity for all"". secretary of state cardinal pietro parolin says the vatican ""respects the american people's choice"" and hopes that donald trump will ""serve the wellbeing and peace of the world"".  ""there is need for everyone to work to change the world situation, which is in great distress"", he is quoted by la repubblica newspaper as saying. foreign policy chief federica mogherini said that trans-atlantic ties with the us went beyond the election of donald trump. ""we'll continue to work together, rediscovering the strength of europe,"" she said.  eu parliament president martin schulz said the result must be honoured and that mr trump ""managed to become the standard-bearer of the angst and fears of millions of americans"". president rodrigo duterte, the philippines' tough-talking leader, offered his ""warm congratulations"" to the us president-elect.  according to his communications secretary, mr duterte ""looks forward to working with the incoming administration for enhanced philippines-us relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law"". several leaders of right-wing parties in europe have also welcomed mr trump's victory. marine le pen, the leader of the far-right french national front (fn), sent her best wishes to mr trump, tweeting: ""congratulations to the new president of the united states donald trump and the free american people!""  dutch anti-islam populist lawmaker geert wilders also tweeted his congratulations. nigel farage, the leader of the uk independence party who played a key role in the referendum leading to britain's exit from the eu, tweeted: ""i hand over the mantle to @realdonaldtrump! many congratulations. you have fought a brave campaign.""   well don't look now, because the next one is just around the corner.  the potential first shots of the next campaign were fired online in the hours after donald trump's victory became clear when hundreds of thousands took to social media to urge the current first lady to run for president in 2020.  ""perfect conditions for michelle obama to win 2020 elections,"" read one comment. another said simply: ""michelle obama 2020 please michelle obama 2020 please michelle obama 2020 please"". mrs obama is that extreme rarity, a popular figure in america's political landscape. her favourability rating, pegged by gallup at 64 percent, is significantly higher than that of donald trump, hillary clinton, or even her husband. there's one small problem for the first lady's supporters, however. in march, she said she had no interest in the top job. on the other hand, a few things have changed since then. blog by mike wendling more us election coverage from bbc trending: the american brexit in the final days of his campaign, donald trump promised a victory that would be ""brexit plus plus plus"" - after his win at the polls it didn't take long for americans and brits to pick up the theme.read more you can follow bbc trending on twitter @bbctrending, and find us on facebook.  all our stories are at bbc.com/trending.   the claim: the electoral college system is a ""disaster for democracy"" because it means a candidate can get the most votes and not win the election.  reality check verdict: it is true to say that in america you can win the popular vote and lose the election. this is also true of the electoral system in the uk and elsewhere. such systems are democratic, although some people would like them to be changed to be more directly representative of how votes were cast. since being elected he has repeated this sentiment, saying he would rather see a system in which, ""you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes, and you win"". but the president-elect has benefited from the system he dubbed undemocratic.  it is likely that the final tallies from last week's election will confirm that more people voted for hillary clinton, but mr trump won, under a system known as the electoral college. campaigning organisations such as national popular vote agree with mr trump, arguing that the candidate most people vote for should get into the white house. two days after seeming to stand by his words, however, mr trump tweeted that the electoral college was ""actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play"".  instead of totting up each person's vote, in the us every state gets a certain number of votes depending partly on the size of its population. the way it's worked out means there's a minimum of three votes per state. in most states, the most popular candidate wins all of its votes, even if 49% of people voted a different way. the system is different in maine and nebraska, where voting is broken down into congressional districts, which means not all the state's electoral college votes have to go to the same candidate. winning a state like california, which gets 55 of the total 538 electoral college votes, will put a candidate a long way towards the 270 state votes needed to win the presidency. even if they win that state by a single vote, they get all 55 votes. it is better to win by a small margin in lots of states than win by a landslide in just a few - the scale of the win (and therefore the number of people who support you) is meaningless - you still only get one state with a fixed number of electoral college votes. candidates identify the states that are safely either republican or democrat - the ones they are bound to lose or win - and broadly ignore these in their campaign efforts. instead, they focus their attentions on the states that tend to swing between the two parties.  this means that, arguably, the election is decided not by the nation as whole but by a small number of so-called battleground states.  if you live in a state where most people support one party, your vote against that party is wasted, whereas if you live in a more divided state your vote has greater influence. electoral college votes also do not match up exactly to population size meaning some people's votes have more clout than others. because the minimum number of votes a state can have is three, the smallest states get electoral power disproportionate to their population. the average state gets one electoral vote for every 565,166 people. but wyoming, which only has a population of 532,668, gets a vote for every 177,556 people, giving those individuals more than three times the electoral influence of the average american.  for many, the idea that you can have the most people vote for you but still lose the election seems undemocratic. this has happened five times in us history, most recently in 2000 when al gore lost to george w bush.  the fact that mr trump won several key swing states very narrowly, while mrs clinton won big majorities in some states is part of the reason she was able to get more votes but still lose the election.  two-thirds (273 out of 399) of campaign events in the 2016 election were held in only six states (florida, north carolina, pennsylvania, ohio, virginia and michigan). it's important to recognise that politicians campaign to the system they are operating in - we cannot say that if the electoral system were different the result would definitely have been different since the candidates may well have campaigned accordingly. could you win a uk general election without winning the popular vote? absolutely - it happened in 1951 and 1974.  as in the us, our first-past-the-post system means any votes you win in a seat where you don't have a majority effectively don't count - it doesn't matter whether you gain 40% or 4% of the votes. there has been a long-running campaign in the uk to reform our electoral system. campaigners have called for a system of proportional representation as far back as 1884.  under the uk's multi-party system, in the most extreme case you could comfortably win the popular vote but get no seats in the house of commons by coming second in every constituency. what is more common is to see a party winning a majority in parliament with as little as 35% or 36% of the popular vote, as labour did in 2005 and the conservatives in 2015. in the 1950s and 1960s, winning parties averaged about 47%. and we can see the same kind of thing happening with the vote share of smaller parties. in 2005, the liberal democrats received 22% of the votes but only won 62 seats, which was less than 10% of the seats in the house of commons.  in the 2015 election, ukip won 3.9 million votes out of a total of around 30 million votes cast nationally, but only ended up with one member of parliament.      republican congressman lou barletta claimed victory long before donald trump did on 8 november. while the ballot counting for president would go on into the wee hours, by 10pm barletta was on a small stage in a high-ceilinged restaurant in downtown hazleton, pennsylvania, thanking his supporters for re-electing him for a fourth term in his 11th district seat. ""i think we win by more each time,"" the 60-year-old said to raucous applause from the crowd of roughly 200.  barletta's district is a long, club-shaped collection of nine counties in the conservative, northeastern part of pennsylvania. it is these rural counties whose republican votes for president often get cancelled out by the big, solidly democratic cities to the south and west: philadelphia and pittsburgh. the state has gone for every democratic presidential candidate since 1992. but on election night 2016, something different happened. for the first time in decades, the voters of rural and suburban pennsylvania overwhelmed the city-dwellers and went red. almost all the polls predicted the state was safely in clinton's grasp. what happened in pennsylvania on 8 november was a huge upset.  luzerne county, where hazleton is located, went for barack obama in 2012 by 52% - this year, trump took the county with 58% of the vote. barletta endorsed trump early in the race, and is said to be one of the few members of congress that the president-elect trusts. he was included in the small group of advisors trump brought to his first national security briefing.  as the evening progressed and the trump victory crept closer to inevitability, barletta - who has said that he was pressured by colleagues not to endorse trump - was feeling vindicated in more ways than one. ""this is a movement that will not die tonight. this movement will live tomorrow because of donald trump,"" he said.  ""i think there's a lot in common with what i started here in hazleton 10 years ago and where we are today."" hazleton is the kind of place reporters go when they want to put a human face on big national issues. in hazleton, the issue is immigration - since 2000, the small coalmining city has gone from over 90% white to nearly 50% hispanic. many migrants came from nearby new york city for jobs and a lower cost of living.  their presence, while it revived what was a dying town, has met significant resistance. in 2006, when barletta was the mayor, he and his city council passed a law that punished landlords for renting to undocumented immigrants and employers for hiring them. barletta made english the town's official language.  though the crime rate has gone up in hazleton, jamie longazel, a professor of sociology at the university of dayton who wrote a book about hazleton's immigration fight, said there is little evidence that it began because of immigrants. unemployment in luzerne county is relatively low, but the jobs available aren't particularly good ones. ""there's a lot of poverty in this town. there's latino folks who are poor and white folks who are poor. with poverty people turn to drugs,"" said longazel. the american civil liberties union sued hazleton, and after a prolonged court battle, the city lost in 2014 and was stuck with the aclu's $1.4m legal bill. the outcome was trumpeted as a victory against racism, hazleton's story became a warning to any city that would try something similar, and barletta was cast as the villain. however, in his own community, barletta's support never waned. he won a second term as mayor, and rode his popularity and hardline stance on immigration to his first congressional term in 2010. though the immigration laws never took effect, the frustration of the white, working class population of hazleton - which suddenly found itself in the minority - did not go anywhere. and they turned out in droves to vote in this election. for anne marie kaschak, a poll watcher for the republican party at a polling place in hazleton, support for trump and support for barletta go hand-in-hand. as soon as she heard trump's now-infamous speech on immigration and building the wall, kaschak said she was a ""pro-trump girl all the way"".  there is a sense among voters like shirley berman, who ran a toy store in hazleton for 40 years, that the town is a microcosm reflecting the broader sense of anger in the country.  ""that makes you angry when you see the change over the years,"" she said. ""it used to be a very safe and co-operative community, and it is no longer safe."" trump supporters had been saying for months that they were part of - as barletta put it - a movement. the media and pundits ignored them. the polls underestimated them. while the political reporters deemed trump's campaign to be one of the worst run in history, volunteers like jen sloot became a foot soldier in trump's supposedly non-existent ground game.  ""i kind of gave up my life for this,"" she said. sloot helped open the trump campaign office in hazleton and is also a huge barletta supporter. a us citizen who immigrated from south africa, sloot made thousands of calls and knocked on countless doors for her candidate over the last several months.  ""i came to this country in 1978, and i did it the right way,"" she said. ""i just feel very strongly that everybody who wants to immigrate to this country should do it the right way. you don't just walk in here … illegal is illegal."" the ground game was also made up of people like mark ondishin - a 51-year-old lifelong resident of hazleton - who was inspired to mobilise politically for the first time in his life. he began volunteering with his wife brenda at the local trump campaign office, making hundreds of phone calls. their dedication, says brenda, has been all-consuming. ""you should see my house,"" she said. on the other end of those campaign calls, mark said he received overwhelming positivity, and a sense of relief that they had someone to unburden themselves to about their mistrust of hillary clinton, about their skyrocketing medical premiums, or their enthusiasm for trump's mexican border wall.  ""the general country's in decline - i think that resonates with voters for trump like me."" ondishin, who was so anxious about the results of the election that he went driving from polling place to polling place just to see how long the lines were, began election night somewhat despondent, believing he was about to see all his hard work amount to nothing. when it became clear that trump was going to win, ondishin turned introspective. ""people want a change, they don't like where the country's going and nothing gets done. that trickles down to all these small towns,"" he said. ""small businesses are the backbone - we take care of the uneducated. the world's gotta have ditchdiggers."" he said that even though he doesn't have to by law, he provides a health care plan for his seven employees. he said his premiums are about to go up by 30%.  ""i can't give them any more raises,"" he said. ""i'm on my wife's [healthcare] plan, that's how bad it's getting. this is why people are frustrated, that's why they're voting for trump."" after clinton's concession in the early hours of 9 november, it became clear that this was a change election. trump was promising white workers their livelihoods back, clinton was a business-as-usual washington dc political elite.  brad morgan, a business owner in harrisburg, about an hour and a half from hazleton, said his fear of clinton's unchecked political power is what motivated him to vote for trump, who he actually didn't like much as a candidate.  ""i did not have a trump sign in my yard, i didn't have trump stickers out there - i do have a hillary for prison sign out there,"" he said. ""donald trump - he basically has half of the gop who doesn't like him, the entire media establishment industrial complex can't stand him. what's he going to be able to get away with? absolutely nothing. ""what would stop the clintons if they got in? absolutely nothing."" part of what helps explain trump's victory is his supporters' utter disdain for the media. at the victory party in hazleton, the tvs were tuned to fox news which drew a surprising number of jeers - clearly even the most conservative us television network is no longer conservative enough for the base.  ""the media is not being honest with the voters in the united states,"" said john keegan, a pharmacy owner in town. ""they have their own agenda. that's part of trump's movement. even if he lost that would continue."" revelations from various media outlets about trump's conduct with women, or the questionable inner workings of his charitable foundation, or the likely content of his taxes, were seen not as news stories but biased attacks on their candidate. and even if the allegations are all true, the change that trump promised was worth taking the bad with the good.  ""that thing with the women cut me like a knife,"" said ondishin. ""but i have no choice but to support him. [the clintons'] control of washington is scary."" on election night, reporters were already asking barletta what he'll do if trump asks him to join his cabinet, but he just smiled and demurred (trump since announced that barletta will be a part of his transition team). what barletta will say is that he sees perfect parallels between his story and trump's: the fight against illegal immigration, the disdain from the media, and an ultimate vindication at the ballot box.  as it turns out trump's voters were not silent or invisible - trump's voters are barletta voters. they're the struggling white working class who felt that for eight years their lives have only gotten harder, their needs shuffled to the bottom of a pile on some desk in washington dc. they've been here the whole time, waiting for a candidate like trump to sweep them off their feet.   ""i think we're going to see america great again,"" barletta said.   the democratic candidate said she had wanted to ""curl up with a good book and never leave the house again"". but in a speech at a children's charity she urged the audience to fight for american values and ""never give up."" mrs clinton won the popular vote but was beaten to the presidency in the all-important us electoral college. ""now i will admit coming here tonight wasn't the easiest thing for me,"" she said as she was honoured by the children's defense fund.  she continued: ""i know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election. i am, too, more than i can ever express. ""i know this isn't easy. i know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether america is the country we thought it was. there was little ceremony and no sign of security for the former presidential candidate who is known simply as ""hillary"" in this circle of friends.  the audience were on their feet and chanting her name as she took to the podium. when she talked about her disappointment, murmurs of agreement spread through the room in waves.  that murmur grew louder as she urged those listening not to lose heart - this was an emotional plea for action. the event was entitled beat the odds, which offers hope for some of america's most underprivileged children and celebrates their achievements.  but i spoke to one man who told me that he could offer little hope to the young african americans he mentors in the wake of this election. hillary clinton used her voice tonight to try to help change that and dissuade others from feeling despondent.  the candidate may be gone, and right now ""hillary"" looks like she might run home and curl back up on the sofa, but there is still a spark left in the first woman who got this far in trying to reach the white house. ""the divisions laid bare by this election run deep, but please listen to me when i say this. ""america is worth it. our children are worth it. believe in our country, fight for our values and never, ever give up."" in her concession speech after her shock defeat last week, mrs clinton said rival donald trump must be given the chance to lead. since then she has kept a low profile, although she was spotted while out walking.  in a phone call leaked to us media she also blamed her loss on fbi director james comey, who announced a new inquiry into her use of a private email server in the run up to the vote.   first, we should look at how badly the polls got it wrong. that's quite complicated because there were hundreds of polls even in the last few weeks of the campaign. we also need to look at both the national polls and those which were conducted in individual states. on average, they overestimated hillary clinton's vote and underestimated donald trump's. however, in national polls the error was not particularly large. the final polls from the main news networks suggested a modest clinton lead. we don't have the final official vote tally yet but, based on what's been counted so far, clinton did score a narrow win in the national popular vote. and with many of the votes still to count coming from strongly-democrat california, it's plausible she will end up with a lead of more than 1%. so, the national polls were not all that far off in terms of total votes. what they got spectacularly wrong was the overall outcome. a 4% popular vote lead for clinton would almost certainly have meant she would have won the electoral college votes to win the presidency as well. also, among the bigger firms there was quite a strong consensus, which made the surprise of the result all the greater. there were some outliers, such as the la times/usc tracking polls, the last poll of which put trump ahead by 3.2 percentage points, but they overestimated support for trump, so it wasn't a resounding success for them either. at the state level, some of the errors were much bigger. none of the polls had suggested that trump would take wisconsin - most gave clinton a comfortable lead. and, while many had suggested trump would win in ohio, the scale of his victory there had not been predicted. but even at state level the extent of the error should not be exaggerated. final polls in florida suggested a virtual dead heat - trump won the state by 1%. in virginia, nevada and colorado the polls were pretty accurate too. overall, though, it was not a good showing. if getting one election wrong could be considered a misfortune, and getting two wrong looks like carelessness, what does it say about the polling industry that this was the third failure at a major election within a period of 18 months? the polling inquiry that followed the 2015 uk general election found that the main problem there had been unrepresentative samples. in other words, the people who agreed to take part in polls did not reflect the population as a whole, even if they looked the same in terms of age, gender, and class background. the case of the eu referendum was a bit different. online polls throughout the campaign pointed to a very close result, and many of them in the final weeks suggested that leave was ahead. but most telephone polls pointed to a remain victory, so the overall picture was unclear. we don't know yet what went wrong with the us polls, but it's possible that they're suffering from a similar systematic problem to that uncovered after the uk general election. certainly, phone pollsters in both countries face an increasing challenge in getting people to participate. perhaps the reason for the failure doesn't matter though. if the polls keep getting it wrong, why should we bother looking at them at all? it's interesting to compare the recent failures with what happened at the 2014 referendum on scottish independence. in that case almost all of the polls suggested that no would win and that scotland would stay in the united kingdom. they got the outcome right, but that doesn't mean they were accurate. the final polls conducted by each of the major companies gave no a lead of between +4 and +7, suggesting a fairly close contest. the final result was that no won by a clear 10.6%. there were some complaints at the time that misleadingly close polls had led the uk government to make more significant promises about devolution than they would otherwise have done, but those complaints were aimed at the handful of ""rogue"" polls that put yes in the lead. very few people suggested there had been a massive polling failure. what this shows is that if the polls suggest the correct outcome, small or moderate inaccuracies are barely noticed. but when they get the outcome wrong it's considered a disaster even if, numerically speaking, they weren't a million miles away. that's perfectly natural of course. we're interested in polls because we hope they can help us predict what will happen. when they get the headline wrong they make us feel like fools. there's probably another factor at work too. in both the eu referendum and the us election, the failure of the polls was exacerbated by the fact that the outcome also confounded the common assumption that voters would end up going for the ""safe"" option - the one that implied continuity, rather than significant change. despite the sequence of failures, it seems unlikely that people will stop commissioning polls. for all their problems, it's hard to think of how else we could get any idea of how people are planning to vote. perhaps one lesson we should take away is that the most we should hope of polls is that they're in the right ballpark - even when lots of them agree. so in close elections we should assume that the only thing polls can really tell us is that the election is indeed close - not that one candidate, or one side, is going to win. it's worth pausing here to reflect on just how close the us result was. if a little under 1% of voters in pennsylvania and florida had gone for clinton instead of trump - about 100,000 of the 120 million who took part - it would have been she who won. had that happened there would probably be a lot less talk about a polling disaster.    The United States presidential election of 2016 was the 58th quadrennial American presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016. The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine. Trump is scheduled to take office as the 45th President, and Pence as the 48th Vice President, on January 20, 2017. Voters selected members of the Electoral College in each state, in most cases by ""winner-takes-all"" plurality; those state electors in turn voted for a new president and vice president on December 19, 2016. While Clinton received about 2.9 million more votes nationwide, a margin of 2.1% of the total cast, Trump won a decisive victory in the Electoral College, winning 30 states with 306 pledged electors out of 538, and overturned the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, as well as the ""blue wall"" of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds in presidential elections since the 1990s. Leading up to the election, a Trump victory was projected unlikely by most media forecasts. In the Electoral College vote on December 19, seven electors voted against their pledged candidates: two against Trump and five against Clinton. A further three electors attempted to vote against Clinton but were replaced or forced to vote again. Ultimately, Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton garnered 227, while Colin Powell won three, and John Kasich, Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, and Faith Spotted Eagle each received one. Trump will be the fifth person in U.S. history to become president despite losing the nationwide popular vote. He will be the first president without any prior experience in public service, while Clinton was the first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major American party.   Article Two of the United States Constitution provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties of the United States, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the President and Vice President. President Barack Obama, a Democrat and former U.S. Senator from Illinois, was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to restrictions of the Twenty-second Amendment; in accordance with Section I of the Twentieth Amendment, his second term expires at noon on January 20, 2017. The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses took place between February and June 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. This nominating process was also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who in turn elected their party's presidential nominee. Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election. On the same day, Politico released an article predicting the 2016 general election would be between Clinton and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, while a New York Times article named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey as potential candidates. With seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history. Prior to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the New Hampshire primary, Christie, Fiorina and Gilmore abandoned the race. Bush followed suit after scoring fourth place to Trump, Rubio and Cruz in South Carolina. On March 1, 2016, the first of four ""Super Tuesday"" primaries, Rubio won his first contest in Minnesota, Cruz won Alaska, Oklahoma and his home of Texas and Trump won the other seven states that voted. Failing to gain traction, Carson suspended his campaign a few days later. On March 15, 2016, the second ""Super Tuesday"", Kasich won his only contest in his home state of Ohio and Trump won five primaries including Florida. Rubio suspended his campaign after losing his home state. Between March 16 and May 3, 2016, only three candidates remained in the race: Trump, Cruz and Kasich. Cruz won most delegates in four Western contests and in Wisconsin, keeping a credible path to denying Trump the nomination on first ballot with 1,237 delegates. Trump then augmented his lead by scoring landslide victories in New York and five Northeastern states in April, followed by a decisive victory in Indiana on May 3, 2016, securing all 57 of the state's delegates. Without any further chances of forcing a contested convention, both Cruz and Kasich suspended their campaigns. Trump remained the only active candidate and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus on the evening of May 3, 2016. Major candidates were determined by the various media based on common consensus. The following were invited to sanctioned televised debates based on their poll ratings. Trump received 14,010,177 total votes in the primary. Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich each won at least one primary, with Trump receiving the highest number of votes and Ted Cruz receiving the second highest. Donald Trump turned his attention towards selecting a running mate after he became the presumptive nominee on May 4, 2016. In mid-June, Eli Stokols and Burgess Everett of Politico reported that the Trump campaign was considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich from Georgia, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. A June 30 Washington Post report also included Senators Bob Corker from Tennessee, Richard Burr from North Carolina, Tom Cotton from Arkansas, Joni Ernst from Iowa, and Indiana Governor Mike Pence as individuals still being considered for the ticket. Trump also stated that he was considering two military generals for the position, including retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. In July 2016, it was reported that Trump had narrowed his list of possible running mates down to three: Christie, Gingrich, and Pence. On July 14, 2016, several major media outlets reported that Trump had selected Pence as his running mate. Trump confirmed these reports in a message on Twitter on July 15, 2016, and formally made the announcement the following day in New York. On July 19, the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pence won the Republican vice presidential nomination by acclamation. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also served in the U.S. Senate and was the First Lady of the United States, became the first Democrat to formally launch a major candidacy for the presidency. Clinton made the announcement on April 12, 2015, via a video message. While nationwide opinion polls in 2015 indicated that Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faced challenges from Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who became the second major candidate when he formally announced on April 30, 2015, that he was running for the Democratic nomination. September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders. On May 30, 2015, former Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third major candidate to enter the Democratic primary race, followed by former Independent Governor and Republican Senator of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee on June 3, 2015, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb on July 2, 2015, and former Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig on September 6, 2015. On October 20, 2015, Webb announced his withdrawal from the Democratic primaries, and explored a potential Independent run. The next day Vice-President Joe Biden decided not to run, ending months of speculation, stating, ""While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent."" On October 23, Chafee withdrew, stating that he hoped for ""an end to the endless wars and the beginning of a new era for the United States and humanity"". On November 2, after failing to qualify for the second DNC-sanctioned debate after adoption of a rule change negated polls which before might have necessitated his inclusion in the debate, Lessig withdrew as well, narrowing the field to Clinton, O'Malley, and Sanders. On February 1, 2016, in an extremely close contest, Clinton won the Iowa caucuses by a margin of 0.2 points over Sanders. After winning no delegates in Iowa, O'Malley withdrew from the presidential race that day. On February 9, Sanders bounced back to win the New Hampshire primary with 60% of the vote. In the remaining two February contests, Clinton won the Nevada caucuses with 53% of the vote and scored a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary with 73% of the vote. On March 1, 11 states participated in the first of four ""Super Tuesday"" primaries. Clinton won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia and 504 pledged delegates, while Sanders won Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont and 340 delegates. The following weekend, Sanders won victories in Kansas, Nebraska and Maine with 15–30-point margins, while Clinton won the Louisiana primary with 71% of the vote. On March 8, despite never having a lead in the Michigan primary, Sanders won by a small margin of 1.5 points and outperforming polls by over 19 points, while Clinton won 83% of the vote in Mississippi. On March 15, the second ""Super Tuesday"", Clinton won in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Between March 22 and April 9, 2016, Sanders won six caucuses in Idaho, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington and Wyoming, as well as the Wisconsin primary, while Clinton won the Arizona primary. On April 19, Clinton won the New York primary with 58% of the vote. On April 26, in the third ""Super Tuesday"" dubbed the ""Acela primary"", she won contests in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania, while Sanders won in Rhode Island. Over the course of May, Sanders accomplished another surprise win in the Indiana primary and also won in West Virginia and Oregon, while Clinton won the Guam caucus and Kentucky primary. On June 4 and 5, Clinton won two victories in the Virgin Islands caucus and Puerto Rico primary. On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press and NBC News reported that Clinton had become the presumptive nominee after reaching the required number of delegates, including pledged delegates and superdelegates, to secure the nomination, becoming the first woman to ever clinch the presidential nomination of a major United States political party. On June 7, Clinton secured a majority of pledged delegates after winning primaries in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, while Sanders only won in Montana and North Dakota. Clinton also won the final primary in the District of Columbia on June 14. At the conclusion of the primary process, Clinton had won 2,204 pledged delegates (54% of the total) awarded by the primary elections and caucuses, while Sanders had won 1,847 (46%). Out of the 714 unpledged delegates or ""superdelegates"" who were set to vote in the convention in July, Clinton received endorsements from 560 (78%), while Sanders received 47 (7%). Although Sanders had not formally dropped out of the race, he announced on June 16, 2016, that his main goal in the coming months would be to work with Clinton to defeat Trump in the general election. On July 8, appointees from the Clinton campaign, the Sanders campaign, and the Democratic National Committee negotiated a draft of the party's platform. On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire in which he appeared with Clinton. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention, the Clinton campaign announced that Virginia Senator Tim Kaine had been selected as her running mate. The following candidates were frequently interviewed by major broadcast networks and cable news channels, or were listed in publicly published national polls. Lessig was invited to one forum, but withdrew when rules were changed which prevented him from participating in officially sanctioned debates. Clinton received 16,849,779 votes in the primary. In April 2016, the Clinton campaign began to compile a list of 15 to 20 individuals to vet for the position of running mate, even though Sanders continued to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries. In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton stated that the most important attribute she looked for was the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president. On July 22, Clinton announced that she had chosen Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia as her running mate. The delegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, which took place July 25–28, formally nominated the Democratic ticket. Third party and independent candidates that have obtained more than 100,000 votes nationally and one percent of the vote in at least one state, are listed separately. Hillary Clinton focused her candidacy on several themes, including raising middle class incomes, expanding women's rights, instituting campaign finance reform, and improving the Affordable Care Act. In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, which proposed a ""clawback"" which would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; with provision of incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; as well as increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an ""exit tax"" on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas. Clinton promoted equal pay for equal work to address current alleged shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do, promoted explicitly focus on family issues and support of universal preschool, expressed support for the right to same-sex marriage, and proposed allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship stating that it ""s at its heart a family issue."" Donald Trump's campaign drew heavily on his personal image, enhanced by his previous media exposure. The primary slogan of the Trump campaign, extensively used on campaign merchandise, was Make America Great Again. The red baseball cap with the slogan emblazoned on the front became a symbol of the campaign, and has been frequently donned by Trump and his supporters. Trump's right-wing populist positions—reported by The New Yorker to be nativist, protectionist, and semi-isolationist—differ in many ways from traditional conservatism. He opposed many free trade deals and military interventionist policies that conservatives generally support, and opposed cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits. Moreover, he has insisted that Washington is ""broken"" and can only be fixed by an outsider. Trump support was high among working and middle-class white male voters with annual incomes of less than $50,000 and no college degree. This group, particularly those with less than a high-school education, suffered a decline in their income in recent years. According to The Washington Post, support for Trump is higher in areas with a higher mortality rate for middle-age white people. A sample of interviews with more than 11,000 Republican-leaning respondents from August to December 2015 found that Trump at that time found his strongest support among Republicans in West Virginia, followed by New York, and then followed by six Southern states. Clinton had an uneasy, and at times adversarial relationship with the press throughout her life in public service. Weeks before her official entry as a presidential candidate, Clinton attended a political press corps event, pledging to start fresh on what she described as a ""complicated"" relationship with political reporters. Clinton was initially criticized by the press for avoiding taking their questions, after which she provided more interviews. In contrast, Trump benefited from free media more than any other candidate. From the beginning of his campaign through February 2016, Trump received almost $2 billion in free media attention, twice the amount that Clinton received. According to data from the Tyndall Report, which tracks nightly news content, through February 2016, Trump alone accounted for more than a quarter of all 2016 election coverage on the evening newscasts of NBC, CBS and ABC, more than all the Democratic campaigns combined. Observers noted Trump's ability to garner constant mainstream media coverage ""almost at will"". However, Trump frequently criticized the media for writing what he alleged to be false stories about him and he has called upon his supporters to be ""the silent majority"". Trump also said the media ""put false meaning into the words I say"", and says he does not mind being criticized by the media as long as they are honest about it. Both Clinton and Trump were seen unfavorably by the general public. In consequence, the controversial nature of both main parties' campaigns marked the road to the election. Clinton's practice of using her own private email address and server during her time as Secretary of State, in lieu of State Department servers, gained widespread public attention back in March 2015. Concerns were raised about security and preservation of emails, and the possibility that laws may have been violated. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into this so-called ""born classified"" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The FBI probe was concluded on July 5, 2016, with a recommendation of no charges, a recommendation that was followed by the Justice Department. On October 28, eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the FBI was analyzing additional emails obtained during its investigation of an unrelated case. On November 6, he notified Congress that the new emails did not change the FBI's earlier conclusion. Also, on September 9, 2016, Clinton stated: ""You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it."" Donald Trump criticized Clinton's remark as insulting his supporters. The following day Clinton expressed regret for saying ""half"", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified ""hateful views and voices"". Previously on August 25, 2016, Clinton gave a speech criticizing Trump's campaign for using ""racist lies"" and allowing the alt-right to gain prominence. On the other side, on October 7, 2016, video and accompanying audio were released by The Washington Post in which Trump referred obscenely to women in a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush while they were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. The audio was met with a reaction of disbelief and disgust from the media. Following the revelation, Trump's campaign issued an apology, stating that the video was of a private conversation from ""many years ago"". The incident was condemned by numerous prominent Republicans like Reince Priebus, Mitt Romney, John Kasich, Jeb Bush  and the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. By October 8 several dozen Republicans had called for Trump to withdraw from the campaign and let Pence head the ticket. Trump insisted he would never drop out. The ongoing of the election made third parties attract voters' attention. On March 3, 2016, Libertarian Gary Johnson addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington DC, touting himself as the third-party option for anti-Trump Republicans. In early May, some commentators opined that Johnson was moderate enough to pull votes away from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who are very disliked and polarizing. Both conservative and liberal media noted that Johnson could get votes from ""Never Trump"" Republicans and disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Johnson also began to get time on national television, being invited on ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Bloomberg, and many other networks. In September and October 2016, Johnson suffered a ""string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs."" On September 8, Johnson, when he appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe, was asked by panelist Mike Barnicle, ""What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo?"" (referring to a war-torn city in Syria). Johnson responded, ""And what is Aleppo?"" Johnson's ""what is Aleppo?"" question prompted widespread attention, much of it negative. Later that day, Johnson said that he had ""blanked"" and that he did ""understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict - I talk about them every day."" On the other hand, Green Party Jill Stein stated that the Democratic and Republican parties are ""two corporate parties"" that have converged into one. Concerned by the rise of the far right internationally and the tendency towards neoliberalism within the Democratic Party, she has said, ""The answer to neofascism is stopping neoliberalism. Putting another Clinton in the White House will fan the flames of this right-wing extremism."" In response to Johnson's growing poll numbers, the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic allies increased their criticism against Johnson in September 2016, warning that ""a vote for a third party is a vote for Donald Trump"" and deploying Senator Bernie Sanders (Clinton's former primary rival and then-supporter) to win over voters who might be considering voting for Johnson or for Stein. This is an overview of the money used in the campaign as it is reported to Federal Election Commission (FEC) and released in September 2016. Outside groups are independent expenditure only committees—also called PACs and SuperPACs. The sources of the numbers are the FEC and Center for Responsive Politics. Some spending totals are not available, due to withdrawals before the FEC deadline. As of September 2016, ten candidates with ballot access have filed financial reports with the FEC. Clinton was endorsed by The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Houston Chronicle, the San Jose Mercury News, the Chicago Sun-Times and the New York Daily News editorial boards. Trump, who has frequently criticized the mainstream media, was not endorsed by the vast majority of newspapers, with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, The Florida Times-Union, and the tabloid National Enquirer his highest profile supporters. Several papers which endorsed Clinton, such as the Houston Chronicle, The Dallas Morning News, The San Diego Union-Tribune The Columbus Dispatch and The Arizona Republic, endorsed their first Democratic candidate for many decades. USA Today, which had not endorsed any candidate since it was founded in 1982, broke tradition by giving an anti-endorsement against Trump, declaring him ""unfit for the presidency"". The Atlantic, which has been in circulation since 1857, gave Clinton its third-ever endorsement (after Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson). Other traditionally Republican papers, including the New Hampshire Union Leader, which had endorsed the Republican nominee in every election for the last 100 years, The Detroit News, which had not endorsed a non-Republican in its 143 years, and the Chicago Tribune, endorsed Gary Johnson. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a non-profit organization, hosted debates between qualifying presidential and vice-presidential candidates. According to the commission's website, to be eligible to opt to participate in the anticipated debates, ""... in addition to being Constitutionally eligible, candidates must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College, and have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations, using the average of those organizations' most recently publicly-reported results at the time of the determination."" The three locations chosen to host the presidential debates, and the one location selected to host the vice presidential debate, were announced on September 23, 2015. The site of the first debate was originally designated as Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio; however, due to rising costs and security concerns, the debate was moved to Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. On August 19, Trump's campaign manager confirmed that he would participate in a series of three debates. Trump had complained that two of the scheduled debates, one on September 26 and the other October 9, will have to compete for viewers with National Football League games, referencing the similar complaints made regarding the dates with low expected ratings during the Democratic Party presidential debates. According to a survey by Rasmussen Reports, the majority of American voters believed that the debate moderators at the presidential debates would be helping Hillary Clinton. The Free & Equal Elections Foundation announced plans to host an open debate among all presidential candidates who had ballot access sufficient to represent a majority of electoral votes. In October 2016 Free & Equal extended the invitation to all candidates with ballot lines representing at least 15% of the electoral vote. The nominees of the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green, Constitution, Reform, and Socialism and Liberation parties, as well as independent candidate Evan McMullin, were invited to participate. The debate was held at the University of Colorado Boulder's Macky Auditorium on October 25, 2016. It was moderated by Ed Asner and Christina Tobin, with Darrell Castle, Rocky De La Fuente, and Gloria La Riva participating. PBS hosted a debate moderated by Tavis Smiley between Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The election was held on November 8, 2016. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton cast her vote in the New York City suburb of Chappaqua, while Republican candidate Donald Trump voted in a Manhattan public school. Throughout the day, the election process went more smoothly than many had expected, with only a few reports of long lines and equipment problems. The Republican candidate performed surprisingly well in all battleground states, especially Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. Even Wisconsin and Michigan, states that were predicted to vote Democratic, were won by Trump. Cindy Adams, present at Trump Tower, reported that ""Trumptown knew they’d won by 5:30. Math, calculations, candidate dislike causing voter abstention begat the numbers"". On November 9, 2016, at 3:00 AM Eastern Time, Trump secured over 270 electoral votes, the majority of the 538 electors in the Electoral College, enough to make him the president-elect of the United States. Clinton called Trump early on Wednesday morning, conceding defeat. Clinton asked her supporters to accept the result and hoped that Trump would be ""a successful president for all Americans"". In his victory speech Trump appealed for unity saying ""it is time for us to come together as one united people"" and praised Clinton who was owed ""a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country"". Six states plus a portion of Maine that Obama won in 2012 switched to Trump. These are (with Electoral College votes in parentheses): Florida (29), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), Iowa (6), and Maine's second congressional district (1). Initially, Trump won exactly 100 more Electoral College votes than Mitt Romney in 2012, with two lost to faithless electors the following month. Thirty-nine states swung more Republican compared to the previous Presidential election, while eleven states and the District of Columbia swung more Democratic. It is estimated that 138.9 million Americans cast a ballot in 2016. 65.8 million of those ballots have been counted for Clinton and just under 63 million for Trump, representing 20.3% (Clinton) and 19.4% (Trump) of the U.S. Census Bureau estimate of U.S. population that day of 324.9 million. Considering a voting age population (VAP) of 251.1 million people and voting eligible population (VEP) of 231.6 million people, this is a turnout rate of 55.3% VAP and 60.0% VEP. Voting turnout percentage was up compared to 2012 (54.9% VAP) but down compared to 2008 (58.2% VAP). More votes were cast in the 2016 election than any prior election due to an increase in the voting population. According to unofficial totals, Trump received more votes than any other Republican in any presidential election, at least 900,000 more than George W. Bush in 2004. Clinton also won more votes than any candidate, Republican or Democrat except Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Third party and write-ins were the highest since 1996, accounting for over 8.2 million votes, 6.00% of valid votes, compared to 2.4 million and 1.85% in 2012. A shooting at a polling place in Azusa, California left two people dead, including the perpetrator, and two others critically injured. The shooting resulted in the closure of polls. Source (Popular Vote): Leip, David. ""2016 Presidential Election Results"". Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections. Retrieved December 19, 2016.  For Bernie Sanders and John Kasich: CA:  and  NH:  VT:  NC:  PA:  (a) Received electoral vote(s) from a faithless elector. (b) Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively. Chris Suprun stated that he cast his presidential vote for John Kasich and his vice presidential vote for Carly Fiorina. The other faithless elector in Texas, Bill Greene, cast his presidential vote for Ron Paul but cast his vice presidential vote for Mike Pence, as pledged. John Kasich received recorded write-in votes in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. (c) Candidate received votes as a write-in. The exact amounts of write-in votes for Sanders have been published for 3 states. In California, his official running mate was Tulsi Gabbard and in New Hampshire and Vermont there was not a running mate attached to Sanders. It was possible to vote Sanders as a write-in candidate in 14 states. Note: Popular vote count is preliminary until all states have certified their results. A total of 29 third party and independent presidential candidates appeared on the ballot in at least one state. Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson and physician Jill Stein repeated their 2012 roles as the nominees for the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, respectively. With ballot access to the entire national electorate, Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes (3.28%), the highest nationwide vote share for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1996, while Stein received almost 1.45 million votes (1.06%), the most for a Green nominee since Ralph Nader in 2000. Independent candidate Evan McMullin, who appeared on the ballot in 11 states, received over 725,000 votes (0.53%). He won 21.4% of the vote in his home state of Utah, the highest share of the vote for a third-party candidate in any state since 1992. Despite dropping out of the election following his defeat in the Democratic primary, Senator Bernie Sanders received 5.7% of the vote in his home state of Vermont, the highest write-in draft campaign percentage for a presidential candidate in American history. Johnson and McMullin were the first third party candidates since Nader to receive at least 5% of the vote in one or more states, with Johnson crossing the mark in 11 states and McMullin crossing it in two. Aside from Florida and North Carolina, the states which secured Trump's victory are situated in the Great Lakes/Rust Belt region. Wisconsin went Republican for the first time since 1984, while Pennsylvania and Michigan went Republican for the first time since 1988. Stein petitioned for a recount in these states. The Clinton campaign pledged to participate in the Green Party recount efforts, while Trump backers challenged them in court. Meanwhile, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente petitioned for and was granted a partial recount in Nevada. Electoral methods ★Two states (Maine and Nebraska) allow for their electoral votes to be split between candidates. The winner within each congressional district gets one electoral vote for the district. The winner of the statewide vote gets two additional electoral votes. Results are from The New York Times. Red denotes states (or congressional districts whose electoral votes are awarded separately) won by Republican Donald Trump; blue denotes those won by Democrat Hillary Clinton. States where the margin of victory was under 1% (50 electoral votes; 46 won by Trump, 4 by Clinton): States/districts where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (83 electoral votes; 56 won by Trump, 27 by Clinton): States where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (96 electoral votes; 78 won by Trump, 18 by Clinton): In the Electoral College vote on December 19, for the first time since 1808, multiple faithless electors voted against their pledged qualified presidential candidate. Five Democrats rebelled in Washington and Hawaii, while two Republicans rebelled in Texas. Two Democratic electors, one in Minnesota and one in Colorado, were replaced after voting for Bernie Sanders and John Kasich respectively. Electors in Maine conducted a second vote after one of its members voted for Sanders; the elector then voted for Clinton. Likewise, for the first time since 1896, multiple faithless electors voted against the pledged qualified vice presidential candidate. Of the faithless votes, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Warren were the only two to receive more than one; Powell received three electoral votes for President and Warren received two for Vice President. Receiving one valid electoral vote each were Sanders, John Kasich, Ron Paul and Faith Spotted Eagle for President, and Carly Fiorina, Susan Collins, Winona LaDuke and Maria Cantwell for Vice President. LaDuke is the first Green Party member to receive an electoral vote, and Paul is the third member of the Libertarian Party to do so, following the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees each getting one vote in 1972. It is the first election with faithless electors from more than one political party. The seven people to receive electoral votes for president were the most in a single election since 1796, and more than any other election since the enactment of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804. Trump's victory, considered unlikely by most forecasts, was characterized as an ""upset"" and as ""shocking"" by the media. Both major-party candidates were unusually old. At 70 years of age, Trump became the oldest person ever to be elected to a first term as president, surpassing Ronald Reagan, who was 7009220097520000000♠69 years, 272 days upon winning the 1980 election. Clinton, at 7009217859760000000♠69 years, 13 days, would have been the second-oldest after Reagan. Along with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Trump was born in 1946; this is the first time a single birth year has produced three presidents. (1946 was a year of unusually numerous births, marking the first year of the post–World War II baby boom.) Trump will become the fifth president to be born in the state of New York, after Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt; he will be the second president born in New York City after Theodore Roosevelt. Trump will also become the third president, after James K. Polk in 1844, and Woodrow Wilson in 1916 to win an election despite losing his home state. Trump became the first person since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 to be elected president without having been elected to any other previous office, and the only individual to be elected president without any prior political or military experience. Among other presidents with limited military or political experience, William Howard Taft never served in the military and had been elected to political office only once, as an Ohio state judge, although he later held a number of appointed federal government positions, including in the Cabinet of a president. Herbert Hoover did not serve in the military and never held elected office, but he led two federal government agencies during and after World War I and served in the Cabinets of two other presidents. However, Trump is unique in not having any state or federal government experience: military, appointed, or elected. Following the announcement of Trump's election, large protests broke out across the United States with some continuing for several days. Protesters have held up a number of different signs and chanted various shouts including ""Not my president"" and ""We don't accept the president-elect"". The movement organized on Twitter under the hashtags #Anti-trump and #NotMyPresident. High school and college students walked out of classes to protest. The protests were peaceful for the most part, although at some protests fires were lit, flags were burned and people yelled rude remarks about Trump. Celebrities such as Madonna, Cher, and Lady Gaga took part in New York. Some protesters took to blocking freeways in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Portland, Oregon, and were dispersed by police in the early hours of the morning. In a number of cities, protesters were dispersed with rubber bullets, pepper spray and bean-bags fired by police. In New York City, calls were made to continue the protests over the coming days after the Election. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani called protesters ""a bunch of spoiled cry-babies."" Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti expressed understanding of the protests and praised those who peacefully wanted to make their voices heard. Various methods were used to forecast the outcome of the 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at the New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania due to demographics targeted by Trump's campaign living in big numbers there, in addition of Clinton's poor performing in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performing in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated states traditionally 'blue' but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red' like Texas which were projected safe for Trump. Early exit polls favored Clinton. However, as polls closed and the results came in throughout the night, those exit polls and forecasts proved inaccurate as the Republican candidate performed surprisingly well in all battleground states, especially Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. Even Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which were considered to be part of the Democrat's firewall that would ensure Clinton's victory, were won by Trump. D = Democrat, R = Republican Pollsters were puzzled by the failure of mainstream forecasting models to predict the 2016 election outcome. Further confusion was attributed to The New York Times' live presidential election forecast website for misleading graphing after analyst Alp Toker identified the use of pseudorandom jitter to give the impression of live fluctuations in its outcome predictions. After the election, computer scientists, including J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome. However, statistician Nate Silver performed a regression analysis which demonstrated that the alleged discrepancy between paper ballots and electronic voting machines ""completely disappears once you control for race and education level"". On November 25, 2016, the Obama administration said the results from November 8, “accurately reflect the will of the American people.” The following day, the White House released another statement saying, “the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.” On November 23, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein launched a public fundraiser to pay for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states; Stein did not provide evidence for her claims. Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that less than 60 000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on November 25, after which Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias stated that their campaign would join Stein's recount efforts in that state and possibly others ""in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides."" Stein subsequently filed for a recount in Pennsylvania on November 28, and in Michigan on November 30. Concurrently, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente sought and was granted a partial recount in Nevada that was unrelated to Stein's efforts. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement denouncing Stein's Wisconsin recount request saying, ""The people have spoken and the election is over."" Trump further commented that the recount ""is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded."" The Trump campaign and Republican Party officials moved to block Stein's three recount efforts through state and federal courts. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered a halt to the recount in Michigan on December 7, dissolving a previous temporary restraining order against the Michigan Board of Elections that allowed the recount to continue, stating in his order: ""Plaintiffs have not presented evidence of tampering or mistake. Instead, they present speculative claims going to the vulnerability of the voting machinery -- but not actual injury."" On December 12, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond rejected an appeal by the Green Party and Jill Stein to force a recount in Pennsylvania, stating that suspicion of a hacked Pennsylvania election ""borders on the irrational"" and that granting the Green Party's recount bid could ""ensure that no Pennsylvania vote counts"" given the December 13, 2016, federal deadline to certify the vote for the Electoral College. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin recount was allowed to continue as it was nearing completion and had uncovered no significant irregularities. The recounts in Wisconsin and Nevada were completed on schedule, resulting in only minor changes to vote tallies. While the incomplete Michigan recount did identify some instances of improper ballot handling and possible voter fraud in some Detroit precincts, no evidence of widespread hacking was found, and the overall outcome of the election remained unchanged by the recount efforts. Intense lobbying (in one case involving claims of harassment and death threats) and grass-roots campaigns have been directed at various GOP electors of the United States Electoral College to convince a sufficient number of them (37) to not vote for Trump, thus precluding a Trump presidency. Members of the Electoral College themselves started a campaign for other members to ""vote their conscience for the good of America"" in accordance with Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Paper No. 68. This group's members may have become faithless electors in the presidential election. On December 5, former candidate Lawrence Lessig and attorney Laurence Tribe established The Electors Trust under the aegis of EqualCitizens.US to provide pro bono legal counsel as well as a secure communications platform for members of the Electoral College who are regarding a vote of conscience against Donald J. Trump. On December 6, Colorado Secretary of State Wayne W. Williams castigated Democratic electors who had filed a lawsuit in Federal court to have the state law binding them to the popular vote (in their case for Hillary Clinton) overturned. On December 10, ten electors, in an open letter headed by Christine Pelosi to the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, demanded an intelligence briefing in light of Russian interference in the election to help Trump win the presidency. After the letter was released, over 20 additional electors signed it. On December 19, several electors voted against their pledged candidates: two against Trump and five against Clinton. A further three electors attempted to vote against Clinton but were replaced or forced to vote again. The 115th United States Congress officially certified the results on January 6, 2017. On December 9, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an assessment to lawmakers in the US Senate, stating that a Russian entity hacked the DNC and John Podesta's emails to assist Donald Trump. The Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed  President Barack Obama ordered a ""full enquiry"" into such possible intervention. President-elect Trump originally mocked the report as fabricated, and Wikileaks denied any involvement of Russian authorities. But a few days later, Trump said he could be convinced of the Russian hacking ""if there is a unified presentation of evidence from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies."" Several U.S. senators—including Republicans John McCain, Richard Burr, and Lindsey Graham—demanded a congressional investigation. Other Republicans, such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and James Lankford of Oklahoma also indicated their support for a full investigation. Voter demographic data for 2016 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day including 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided in large part by his strong margins among Northern whites without college degrees; while Obama (in 2012) and Kerry (in 2004) lost those voters by a margin of 10 points, Clinton lost them by a margin of 20 points. The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters. Additionally, Trump nearly doubled his support from Muslims compared to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. While exit polls are useful, they have in the past overstated or given partial portraits of the electorate, and further study with additional data is generally required.

3,French Politics," marine le pen, the leader of france's national front (fn), is fighting to achieve a similar earthquake in france in the presidential elections in 2017.  but with her increasing appeal to the centre and the left of french politics, how many of her policies really belong to the far right? marine le pen is the youngest daughter of jean-marie le pen, former leader of the fn and a convicted racist, who last year repeated an old anti-semitic slur that the nazi gas chambers were ""a detail of history"".  having grown up in a political home, accompanying him to meetings from the age of 13, marine le pen was always going to struggle to shake off the far-right label.  but she did denounce her father's comments in 2015, and effectively expelled him from the party. while her father was leader, the fn was the party that wanted to deport three million foreigners, the party of holocaust-denial and xenophobia. but under marine le pen the fn began to distance itself from such controversial issues.  such efforts at detoxification have proved successful, with polls suggesting support for the fn climbing from 18% in 2010 to about 24% today.  nonetheless, when voters are questioned they still place the fn and ms le pen ""way more to the right than other parties"", says nonna mayer, expert in racism and the fn at sciences po university. where does she go from here in her pursuit of a detoxified party? the fn has traditionally been a male, blue-collar-dominated party, and the leader needs to target women, says dr mayer. so ms le pen has softened her approach to women's rights, and even sees herself as a quasi-feminist. in fact, dr mayer argues, in many respects ms le pen is more socially liberal than much of the mainstream right - something that has caused divisions within her own party. ms le pen has called for a massive reduction in legal immigration, arguing french citizenship should be ""either inherited or merited"".  as for illegal immigrants, they ""have no reason to stay in france, these people broke the law the minute they set foot on french soil"". but if that is a far-right stance, it is not very different from that of centre-right rival francois fillon, who was elected as the republican candidate on similar promises: ""we've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum,"" he says.   in a world where the centre is shifting to the right, and the right is shifting to the centre, the lines are getting blurred. the two are now competing for some of the same voters. while mr fillon is regarded as appealing more to the ""respectable"" middle classes, marine le pen is claiming to speak for ""all people"", and increasingly appealing to a wider electorate, even muslim voters in the french suburbs.  however, in december she upped the ante by announcing that she would end free education for the children of undocumented immigrants.  ""if you come to our country don't expect to be taken care of, to be looked after, that your children will be educated without charge,"" she said in a speech in paris. and, more threateningly, ""playtime is over"". long before the paris attacks, marine le pen made a link between immigration and militant islamism. in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on 13 november 2015, she proposed to ""expel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil"" and to strip dual-nationality muslims with extremist views of citizenship, a view traditionally associated with the far right.  in an unprecedented move, those ideas were endorsed both by socialist prime minister manuel valls and by president francois hollande, before eventually being dropped. many of her views have been echoed by francois fillon too. mr fillon, a devout catholic, described radical islam as a ""totalitarianism like the nazis"". catholics, protestants and jews ""don't denounce the values of the republic,"" he said, indicating that was not the case with islam. ""the clear blue water between the fn and the other parties has been disappearing and disappearing,"" says james shields, professor of french politics at aston university.  the national front is to the right of the republicans on law and order issues, says nonna mayer. it is the only party looking to restore the death penalty, an issue that divides the party's core supporters from the mainstream. polls suggest 60% of fn voters are in favour, compared with 28% of mainstream-right and 11% of left-wing voters. the fn has yet to publish its election manifesto, but its 2012 proposals included upping police numbers and powers and creating 40,000 new prison places. treatment of immigrants in france is probably the standout, far-right policy of marine le pen's fn. and it is central to the party's platform. jobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to french nationals before they get to ""foreigners"".  the centre of gravity of french politics may have shifted to the right. but no other party has adopted favouritism across the social services - and it could breach the law. ""she is upholding a policy that not only is thought by constitutional experts to be unconstitutional, but has been judged by the law to be unlawful,"" says prof shields.  in 1998, a national front mayor, catherine megret, tried to implement a new policy that would give a family allowance to french or eu families, but not to other foreign families.  ""did it stand up in court? no,"" says prof shields. but, he says, so-called nativism remains central in marine's platform."" marine le pen appeals to french voters fed up with mainstream politics, but there is nothing far right about that. if she wins the presidency in may, she has promised an eu referendum in france within six months of taking office. and the uk's vote to leave the eu in june 2016 has provided the template. portraying herself as beyond the establishment, she has championed public services - for non-foreigners - and presented herself as a protector of workers and farmers in the face of ""wild and anarchic globalisation"". ""she's managing to get these approval ratings by doing a trump,"" says prof shields. but here the lines are blurred too: left-wing parties are playing the anti-establishment, anti-globalisation card as well. but what sets her european views apart from the rest of the french right is the company she keeps. the fn has strong ties with the dutch freedom party (pvv), austria's freedom party (fpoe), belgium's flemish interest (vb), alternative for germany (afd) and the italian northern league (ln). they are all part of the fn-led europe of nations and freedom grouping in the european parliament and are either right-wing populist or, in the case of the fpoe, far right. geert wilders, of leader of the dutch pvv, wants to ban the koran. the italian northern league's leader matteo salvini is known for his praise of fascist leader benito mussolini. these views are toxic to the political right in europe, and many centre-right parties have said they will not form coalitions with them.   france sexism; formula 1 wonder boy; italy to double baby bonus; eurovision song share this with see all episodes from newshour   french female ministers decry harassment; major security alert at manchester united; former cia agent confesses tip-off led to mandela's arrest (photo: christine lagarde, credit: afp/getty images) share this with see all episodes from the newsroom   marking 150 years since the publication of das kapital, tim stanley, a former marxist, makes the case that the right's ideological debt to marx is almost as large as that of the left. he argues that, both historically and on a personal level, conservatism is largely a response to marxism. share this with see all episodes from archive on 4   the week in politics is previewed and reviewed, with news, views and interviews as well as the latest gossip. share this with see all episodes from sunday supplement   not perhaps the most appropriate symbols of this moment in the republic's history. below her statue in the place de la republique, candles and flowers lie in tribute, after the attacks that have shaken this country to the core.  the hard-line response of president francois hollande might suggest he'd like to see her instead holding an assault rifle and a ledger of new laws.  french politics is in a state of flux. how he and others respond to the enormous challenge posed by mass murder is likely to dictate how france, and maybe europe, changes over the next few months and years.  the mood in paris after the slaughter at charlie hebdo and in the jewish supermarket was one of defiant solidarity with those who were targeted. ""we are all charlie,"" was the sentiment.  the attacks on friday night, on a rock concert, a football match, on people eating and drinking, had a different meaning. ""we're all targets,"" is nearer the mood this time. not a declaration of faith but a realisation of vulnerability.  it is a moment when people look to their politicians for solutions. but to this president? mr hollande has the worst opinion poll ratings of any french president ever. in early october one put his approval rating at just 17%.  it had risen to the dizzying heights of 22% shortly after his tough response to the charlie hebdo murders. another poll, slightly later last month, suggested his unpopularity was growing.   so it is little surprise that the notion of solidarity only lasted a few hours and his rivals were uncompromising.   the leader of the front national (fn), marine le pen, did suspend her campaign for the regional elections (the party is expected to do very well in the north and south west), but she called for france to rearm, take back control of its borders, and destroy radical islam. 1972: founded by former soldier and far-right politician jean-marie le pen. stakes out strongly nationalist, economically protectionist, anti-immigration agenda in following years. 1987: mr le pen first makes public comments calling the nazi holocaust a ""detail of history"". he is subsequently convicted several times of racism or inciting racial hatred 2002: fn causes an earthquake in french politics when mr le pen beats socialist candidate lionel jospin in presidential elections to reach a run-off against jacques chirac 2011: marine le pen succeeds her father as fn leader, tries to ""detoxify"" the party brand, distance it from accusations of anti-semitism. critics say the party's focus simply switched to muslims 2012: comes third in presidential elections, with 17.9% of the vote 2015: ms le pen is charged with inciting racial hatred for comments about muslims praying in the street. her trial came weeks before local elections, due in december, in which the fn's anti-immigration and anti-eu message is expected to play well jean-marie le pen interview profile: marine le pen former president nicolas sarkozy, leader of the ump, recently renamed the republicans, called for a new european immigration policy, beefed-up security and a fresh foreign policy. so much for national unity.  it is hardly surprising that the president, often portrayed as flabby and weak, has announced a raft of draconian measures, endorsing, rather than diminishing the sense of national crisis.   he wants to change the constitution to allow a continued state of emergency - it's actually described as a ""state of siege"" in his speech - allowing french people to be stripped of their citizenship and barred from the country if they have a second nationality and are convicted of terrorism, to look again at when police can use deadly force, putting plans to cut defence spending on ice and recruiting 5,000 more officers. perhaps most importantly, the determination to destroy the islamic state militant group is put above getting syrian president bashar al-assad out of power.  if a rapprochement with the russians was on the cards before, this strengthens president vladimir putin's hand and desirability as a partner. it is hardly ""keep calm and carry on"". one foreign observer said: ""some of the ideas (some would say most of them) seem to come from the platforms of european right-wing parties, even the extreme right-wing."" the sense of a national emergency is no doubt fully justified, but riding the tiger of perpetual crisis is a dangerous gambit. some might argue it is exactly what the terrorists want - others that it is a bit late. indeed, that is exactly what ms le pen is saying. she is a far more subtle, sophisticated politician than her father - undermining suspicions of her party with displays of considered reasonableness. her tone now is, rather more in sadness than anger, ""we told you so"". after mr hollande's speech, she said many of the measures were to be welcomed, and would be supported by the fn.   but she went on to say that mr hollande was still defending borders that leaked like a sieve, indulging in the ""fad"" of welcoming immigrants and refusing to fight against radical islam and multiculturalism.  it is very hard to predict how this argument will fare in the coming elections. but the sense that this has been a long time coming may have heads nodding.  in my interview with professor andrew hussey, he observed that for historical reasons parts of the south had become an fn fiefdom and the attacks might further the sense that paris was a different country - almost that terrorism was a problem of the capital and it was best that it stayed there. in that dreariest of reporter's phrases, only time will tell how these horrific murders affect the election, but they have already had a huge impact on the landscape - the unpopular left-wing president has shifted to the right with measures ranging from populist to simply hard line.   he has absorbed the key suggestions of his two rivals, which could neuter them and change his public image.   the french republic, in its several incarnations, is no stranger to authoritarian reactions at critical moments - but it is harder than in most countries to predict whether this will satisfy the public mood, create a demand for even stronger measures or indeed, in this contrary nation, simply be seen as an offence against notions of liberty and fraternity.     the political system was paralysed, he said. ""i want to free the energy of the able while protecting the weakest."" after serving under socialist president francois hollande, he is now running as an independent. his move has unsettled rivals from both the left and right hoping to represent france's mainstream parties. the conservative republican party will begin selecting its own candidate in new, us-style primaries on sunday. earlier, frontrunner alain juppe accused mr macron of betraying president hollande, saying he had ""stabbed him in the back"". a one-time protege of the president, mr macron quit the socialist government in august amid discontent within the party over his political ambitions. mr hollande has not yet confirmed whether he will stand for re-election in april and will make a decision in the coming weeks. he has the lowest popularity ratings of any post-war french president. mr macron, a former investment banker who has never been elected, ended the speculation at a press conference in a paris suburb.  ""france is... blocked by corporatism of all kinds,"" he said, referring to large interest groups. ""i reject this system."" he will run as head of the centrist en marche movement he created in april, which now has almost 97,000 members and has received €2.7m ($2.9m; £2.3m) in donations. the movement advocates ""new ideas... neither of the right nor the left"". mr macron repeated the theme on wednesday, saying: ""the challenge is not for me to bring together the left or bring together the right. the challenge is to bring together france."" benoit hamon, a candidate for the socialist nomination, lamented mr macron's independent candidacy, telling bfmtv it was almost guaranteed to split the left vote and prevent any single candidate reaching the second round of the presidential vote. meanwhile marine le pen, leader of the burgeoning far-right national front dismissed mr macron as ""a candidate of the banks, there's always one"". reaction on social media was mixed. one survey suggests that 38% of french voters believe mr macron would be a good president. his candidacy also caused upset among some of the centre-right candidates vying for the republican nomination.  former prime minister juppe is favourite to win the poll, running on a moderate ticket but he is facing stiff competition from former president nicolas sarkozy, who is running a law-and-order campaign, and thatcherite former pm francois fillon. mr sarkozy's bid was dealt a blow on tuesday after new allegations emerged that he had received millions of euros in illegal financing from the regime of late libyan dictator muammar gaddafi. he and his former chief of staff have denied wrongdoing in the case, which involves funding for his successful 2007 presidential campaign. meanwhile, president hollande has said france's state of emergency should continue until the election. it was due to be lifted in january, having been in place since the november 2015 terror attacks in paris. mr hollande's proposal would see it kept until 7 may, the second and final round of the presidential election.   german chancellor angela merkel will run for office for a fourth term; donald trump and his meetings in bedminster; bernard-henri lévy on the future of french politics (photo: german chancellor angela merkel at a christian democratic union (cdu) meeting; credit: tobias schwarz /afp/getty images) share this with see all episodes from newshour   a look back at the two very different campaigns fought by the french presidential candidates and how education informed their agendas. also on the programme: a look at the educational progress being made by the new south african government. share this with see all episodes from the learning world   france is one of the countries in western europe that is struggling to counter extremism. january's attack on the charlie hebdo magazine and a jewish supermarket prompted questions about how to reconcile different sections of society. it also led to an upsurge in support for the far-right front national.  it is a political party some regard as racist, but rosine nahounou, who is of ivorian descent, explains why she is an active supporter of front national.   the 27th africa-france summit has kicked off this friday, under tight security. more than 30 heads of state gathered in bamako, including french president franã§ois hollande. before heading to mali's capital, he visited french troops in the town of gao. nigeria's president, muhammadu buhari, leads a regional delegation in banjul, in a bid to convince gambian president yahya jammeh to step down when his mandate expires.

              in this edition, we take a look at the carbon footprint of the internet. how much do you pollute when you send an email or a tweet and what are big tech firms doing to reduce their co2 emissions? we also discuss the legal status of robots and the necessity to create rules to regulate how humans will interact with artificial intelligence. and in test 24, we test the ear plug bang by french start-up inspear, which gives soldiers tunable hearing.

              this week, we explore the social wonders of cooking. good food is good for the body, and making it can be good for the soul. cuisine can connect generations, break down barriers, and give people a purpose in life. we take a look at some initiatives creating a positive social impact through the culinary world. we also talk to french gastronomy star thierry marx (pictured), whose goal is to help disadvantaged youth, former prisoners and the unemployed find jobs and a purpose through cooking.

              on january 20, donald trump will be sworn in as 45th president of the united states. with his promise of radical change in american politics, he won several states that until then had voted solidly democrat. among them was wisconsin. how did the new york billionaire win over this rural and working-class state? our reporter gallagher fenwick went to meet his voters. with its fields as far as the eye can see and its paper mills, wisconsin represents the heart of america.  both rural and industrial, this northern us state had long been a democratic stronghold. no republican had won here since ronald reagan in 1984. in fact, hillary clinton was so sure of winning wisconsin that she did not visit it once during the presidential campaign. but on november 8, 2016, everything changed: wisconsin narrowly voted for donald trump. no one had predicted this result. today, simply visiting this state, best known for its dairy products, helps us better understand how its working-class and rural voters were won over by a new york billionaire. for conservatives in wisconsin, the victory of an unorthodox, anti-establishment candidate felt like getting revenge on a democratic elite that was deemed contemptuous of them. some recall that the outgoing president barack obama accused the conservatives of clinging to their weapons and their religion. and the attacks of hillary clinton, who called donald trumpâs voters a ""basket of deplorables"", made things worse. neither red (republican) nor blue (democratic), this divided midwest state is best described as purple. itâs difficult to know at first glance whom a person voted for. the stories we gathered are not those of voters struggling to make ends meet, nor of uneducated americans. from the businesswoman to the farmer, but avoiding the clichã©s, our reporter gallagher fenwick has been to meet some of those who enabled the surprise victory of the 45th us president. â

              in november 2016, india's government shocked the country when it announced that a massive 85% of banknotes were no longer legal tender. the move, championed by prime minister narendra modi, aimed to stamp out corruption and the black market. more recently, modi addressed the nation once again, exposing his vision of a ""digital india"" and prompting people to download a virtual wallet for cashless transactions. but is this revolution too much too soon for the average indian? a programme prepared by patrick lovett and elom marcel toble.

              at last, thereâs some good news for the global economy. the world bank says growth should pick up slightly this year, thanks to a recovery in emerging markets. we speak to the organisation's lead economist. also in this programme, the us dollar feels the trump effect. but who wins and who loses from a stronger greenback? plus: is it the end of the siesta in spain? the government wants to encourage businesses to work nine to five.

              french astronaut thomas pesquet floated into space on his first-ever spacewalk friday, and helped install three new, refrigerator-sized lithium-ion batteries to upgrade the power system at the international space station.
 wearing a white spacesuit with the french flag emblazoned on one shoulder, pesquet and us astronaut shane kimbrough switched on their spacesuits' internal battery power to mark the official start of the spacewalk at 6:22 am (1122 gmt). ""this is pesquet's first foray into the vacuum of space,"" a nasa commentator said as a live broadcast from the us space agency showed pesquet's booted feet dangling out of the airlock as he made his way outside. the pair made speedy progress. about three hours into the spacewalk, they had finished their main goal of connecting adapter plates for the three lithium-ion batteries. then, they carried out a series of maintenance jobs, performing six extra tasks in all, before the spacewalk ended five hours and 58 minutes later at 12:20 pm (1720 gmt). a nasa commentator described the outing as ""completely successful,"" as the two men, clad in bulky white spacesuits and gloves, grasped hands and high-fived each other inside the space station. new batteries  the new batteries weigh about 428 pounds (194 kilograms) each, and replace older, but far lighter, nickel hydrogen batteries. the batteries store energy and supply the solar-powered orbiting lab when it flies in earth's shadow. the space station travels at a speed of more than 17,000 miles (27,350 kilometers) per hour, and circles the earth about every 90 minutes, periodically moving through light and darkness. after a spacewalk earlier this month by kimbrough, 49, and veteran us astronaut peggy whitson, 56, a total of six lithium-ion batteries are now installed. eventually, all 48 of the old batteries on board will be replaced with new ones. first outing for pesquet  pesquet, 38, is the fourth french astronaut to perform a spacewalk, and the 11th european. it was kimbrough's fourth career spacewalk. the spacewalk was the 197th for maintenance and assembly at the orbiting outpost, a global science collaboration of more than a dozen nations including russia, the united states and japan. back at mission control in houston, texas, italian astronaut luca parmitano orchestrated the spacewalk, giving the men directions and asking them periodically to check their gloves and helmets. the european space agency described parmitano's role as lead communicator as ""a recognition of esa's expertise in station operations."" parmitano went on two spacewalks during his six-month mission in 2013. shortly after the start of one of those spacewalks, parmitano's helmet began filling with a water leak and he had to be rushed back inside the station for emergency aid. parmitano is also a friend of pesquet. they trained together for six years in the european astronaut corps. parmitano said that ahead of friday's spacewalk, he gave pesquet some words of advice: go slow and take plenty of pictures. when it was over, parmitano told the men from his seat at mission control: ""thank you for your hard work. it has been a privilege.""

              former french prime minister manuel valls on thursday defended a controversial labour reform passed under his tenure as he squared off against other left-wing presidential hopefuls in a televised debate. seven candidates vying for franceâs left-wing presidential nomination presented the main points of their campaigns as they faced off in the first of four primary debates. former government ministers arnaud montebourg and benoit hamon said they would repeal the law allowing french companies to fire workers more easily, forcing valls â the touted frontrunner in the race â into a defensive stand. â[the law] was not debated by the unions and it was not debated by the parliament, because it was forced through,â montebourg said, taking aim at valls for bypassing lawmakers in july. âitâs impossible to pass a law for 29 million workers without consulting with their representatives in the unions or in parliament.â ârepeal what exactly, the right for workers to negotiate in their companies?â valls heatedly shot back, insisting that several provisions, including the so-called âright to disconnectâ, remained popular measures. 
        
                    
                
    
 the first round of franceâs left-wing primary will be held on january 22, with the two candidates claiming the most votes advancing to a run-off poll on january 29. the debate also included former education minister vincent peillon and three candidates from smaller parties allied to the ruling socialists in parliament: franã§ois de rugy, jean-luc bennahmias and sylvia pinel, who is the only woman in the primary race. socialist divisions valls also faced criticism for his governmentâs failed bid in march to introduce an amendment to the constitution that would have allowed authorities to strip dual nationals of their french citizenship in terror cases.

  the former premier, who stepped down in december to launch his presidential bid, said he regretted âsowing division within the partyâ over the proposed text. throughout the debate valls nevertheless defended his tenure, saying he was âproudâ of what he had accomplished alongside president franã§ois hollande. the socialist president, whose job approval ratings sank to historic lows last year, announced in december that he would not run for re-election. hollande and valls have shepherded a string of pro-business policies and clamped down on civil liberties in recent years, angering many left-wing voters and even members of their own party. attacking fillon despite arguing â sometimes vigorously â the primary rivals unanimously praised hollande and valls over their response to a series of terrorist attacks that have struck france in the past two years. âi salute the government for its reaction, and i salute the french people, who never once expressed a desire for vengeance,â montebourg said. âthe work that has been done is what will allow us to overcome.â all seven candidates agreed on the need to add more police and specialised judges to fight against terrorist cells in the country, and said they supported raising military and intelligence spending. the left-wing candidates also took turns attacking conservative presidential nominee franã§ois fillon, arguing that his goal was to dismantle franceâs social model, and questioning his overtures to russian president vladimir putin. franã§ois de rugy said that one of the biggest threats facing france was the âexpansionist policy of vladimir putinâ, warning that both fillon and far-right presidential candidate marine le pen âwant an alliance with putin, in particular in syria to support [syrian president] bashar al-assad.â date created : 2017-01-13

              the targeted killing of terrorists abroad is justified to protect national security, most candidates in thursday's left-wing primary debate for the french presidency agreed. however, most also argued that the public should not be told about it. ""we are at war, we must protect the french people,"" said former prime minister manuel valls at the first of four debates among seven candidates vying for the left-wing nomination for the upcoming presidential election. but ""on these subjects, when what has to be done must be done, what must be kept secret must be kept secret"", valls added.  ""this is how we embody the authority of the state and, above all, how we protect the french people."" current french president franã§ois hollande, who has decided not to run for a second term as president amid record-low approval ratings, admitted to ordering targeted executions of french terrorists abroad in an interview for a controversial tell-all book published in october. while most of the candidates said they would be willing to order the assassination of terrorists overseas in the name of national security, they also rebuked hollande for his public admission. ""i don't believe that chatting about these state secrets is appropriate for a statesman,"" said vincent peillon, a former minister for education in hollande's government. while there may be times politicians have to make tough choices to protect the public, he said, ""to highlight them is indecent, and making them a subject for the press is no better"". 'limit' to transparency fellow candidate arnaud montebourg said he would be prepared to order overseas killings of terrorists if it were ""in the best interests of france"", but said he was ""very shocked"" by hollande's ""violation of defence secrets"". benoit hamon, a former education minister under hollande, said that ""sobriety"" was needed when talking about such subjects. 
        
                    
                
    
 ""sobriety in the commentary on what has been done and in the need to do everything possible to protect our fellow citizens"", he said. along with members of the ruling socialist party, the debate also included candidates from smaller parties allied to the socialists in parliament. one of them, franã§ois de rugy, leader of the ecologist party, said carrying out extrajudicial killings of terrorists abroad was ""sometimes necessary"", but also took issue with hollande's decision to talk about it in public. ""i have always been for transparency but i have always said that there is a limit,"" he said. only sylvia pinel, the primary's sole female candidate, would not be drawn on whether she would be prepared to order the assassination of terrorists in foreign countries. ""it is not for the candidates in this election to comment on this type of information,"" she said. the first round of franceâs left-wing primary will be held on january 22, with the two candidates claiming the most votes advancing to a run-off poll on january 29.

              french far-right presidential hopeful marine le pen was spotted at trump tower on thursday, but a spokesman for the us president-elect said she would not be meeting him â nor any members of his transition team.  the national front leader, who has been lavish in her praise of trump, was seen having coffee at trump ice cream parlor on the manhattan towerâs ground floor. she was in the company of three men including her partner louis aliot, the partyâs vice-president. it was not clear what the purpose of their visit was. sean spicer, trumpâs pick for white house press secretary, said le pen was not scheduled to meet with the president-elect or anyone on his team.

  trump has been hosting a series of meetings with business and political leaders at his opulent new york penthouse before taking office on january 20. the tower has long been a tourist attraction due to the president-elect's reality tv career, but now that he is on the brink of moving into the white house, the building in the heart of new york has never been more popular with visitors. le pen, whose party holds anti-eu, anti-immigrant views, described trump's victory as a ""sign of hope"" for people who oppose globalisation. her campaign confirmed on thursday she was making a surprise visit to new york, but characterised it as a private trip. date created : 2017-01-12 marine le pen in trump tower pic.twitter.com/yc3pu7evcbâ sam levine (@srl) january 12, 2017

              franceâs emmanuel macron has come under fire for addressing a conference on the european union in english, with the far right accusing the centrist presidential candidate of disrespecting both his country and the language of moliã¨re. macron, 39, a french investment banker turned economy minister turned presidential candidate, gave a speech in english on franco-german relations and his hopes for the european union at the humboldt university in berlin on tuesday. he also tweeted from the conference in both english and in french.

 the leader of franceâs anti-eu national front party, marine le pen, immediately criticised the move, tweeting that [see original tweet below in french]: âpresidential candidate macron goes to berlin to do a conference in english ... poor france!â 
     
le candidat ãâ  la prãâ©sidentielle macron va ãâ  berlin faire une confãâ©rence en anglais... pauvre france ! mlpâ marine le pen (@mlp_officiel) january 10, 2017

 
 
florian philippot, le penâs right-hand man, chimed in, saying: ""it's not just that he doesn't respect our language, he doesn't believe in france"". rare for french politicians to speak english it is quite rare for french politicians to speak in english â even when they travel abroad â as many of them do not have good grasp of english and take pride in preserving the french language. former french president jacques chirac, for example, reportedly stormed out of an eu summit in 2006 in protest at a french delegate addressing the audience in english. an increasing number of franceâs young people, however, feel that their leaders need to improve their english. a poll conducted by language school âaba englishâ last year showed that 64 percent felt the english language skills of their politicians were inadequate, so perhaps macronâs skill is in fact a bonus for the electorate. hailing merkelâs policies while in berlin, macron, who quit president franã§ois hollandeâs socialist government last year to run as an independent in the upcoming presidential election, also defended the eu and hailed german chancellor angela merkelâs policies on both migrants and the economy. this stands in stark contrast to hollandeâs former prime minister manuel valls who, while visiting berlin last february, called germanyâs liberal policies on refugees âunsustainableâ. although analysts see the outcome of this french presidential election as highly unpredictable, macron is increasingly seen closing in on both le pen and franã§ois fillon of the center right who are currently favourites. date created : 2017-01-12 ne laissez jamais ceux qui doutent occuper l'espace. votre rãâ´le est de critiquer l'europe, de la challenger. mais de toujours la dãâ©fendre. pic.twitter.com/1rpk0owyavâ emmanuel macron (@emmanuelmacron) january 10, 2017 le candidat ãâ  la prãâ©sidentielle macron va ãâ  berlin faire une confãâ©rence en anglais... pauvre france ! mlpâ marine le pen (@mlp_officiel) january 10, 2017

              a total of seven candidates from franceâs main left-wing parties will take part on thursday in the first of four televised primary debates that could make or break the ruling socialist party.   the debates, which will be held over the course of the next two weeks, are seen as crucial for a successful turnout in the countryâs left-wing presidential primaries on january 22 and 29. as the first round of voting approaches, there is dwindling support among french voters for the socialist party, which has been left fractured by ideological differences and the outgoing president franã§ois hollandeâs unpopular leadership. france 24 spoke with thomas guã©nolã©, a political scientist and lecturer at the prestigious sciences po university in paris, who emphasized the socialist party's divisions ahead of thursdayâs debate. france 24: why are the left-wing primary debates important for the socialist party? thomas guã©nolã©: the socialist party is historically the main left-wing party in france. but it is strongly divided between its own right-leaning and left-leaning members. franã§ois hollande, the current president of the french republic, comes from this party, and has governed with a right-leaning agenda. he has decided not to run for a second term, because he feels he cannot unify the left. there are two things at stake for the socialist party. first, they need a high level of participation. the conservative primary [in november] drew more than four million voters. if, for example, only one million turn out for the left-wing primaries, it will be considered a failure. the second thing at stake is that the socialist party is also split among former economy minister emmanuel macron, who is pro-free trade and deregulation, and jean-luc mã©lenchon, whoâs a proponent of alter-globalisation [a movement that opposes the negative effects of neoliberal globalisation]. france 24: who are the socialist party candidates, and what are their strengths and weaknesses? guã©nolã©: there are [four socialist party] candidates in the upcoming left-wing primaries. thereâs manuel valls, who was prime minister under hollande until he recently resigned to run for the presidency. over the last 10 years, manuel valls has been the most right-leaning of the socialist party. there are even some who have accused him of being right wing, period. he has backed economic austerity, strict immigration policyâ¦ but for this campaign, he is trying to run on a different platform. during his tenure as prime minister, he repeatedly used the 49.3 [a clause in the french constitution that allows governments to force through legislation without a vote], now he says that itâs too brutal. he also says that he now wants reconciliation, whereas he was quite confrontational as prime minister. heâs basically trying to remake his image, even though itâs contradictory. next thereâs vincent peillon, who is an esteemed university professor. heâs well known among academic circles, where heâs considered an authority on the issue of secularism. heâs also a former minister of education. heâs unbeatable when it comes to three subjects: secularism, education and defending the rights of franceâs muslim minority. but beyond that, he doesnât have much to say.  
        
                    
                
    
  then thereâs arnaud montebourg, the former economy minister. heâs got one strong position, which is that he wants to do the exact opposite of hollande and valls when it comes to the economy. he basically wants to copy [former us president franklin d. roosevelt] and the new deal. heâs really selling it hard. his main challenge will be to address other issues than the economy. last but not least, thereâs benoã®t hamon, who is running as the most left-leaning socialist party candidate. he has proposed such audacious measures as introducing a universal basic income, and the 32-hour workweek. his main weakness is that he can be easily attacked on how he plans to finance these proposals. each candidate has their own weakness to overcome. valls has a credibility problem, peillon lacks breadth, montebourg is strong on economy but doesnât have a diverse enough platform, and hamon has a feasibility problem. france 24: why is there dwindling voter support for the socialist party? guã©nolã©: there are two kinds of left-leaning and centre-left leaning voters. there are those who believe thereâs no more socialist party because they have betrayed economic policy and who will likely vote for mã©lenchon or hamon, and then there are those who see the socialist party as traitors for the opposite reason. the primary is a secession war within the socialist party. itâs an electoral one, but there are those who want free trade and deregulation, and those who want alter-globilisation. france 24: what will happen if the debates fail to rally voters? guã©nolã©: the debates have two main challenges. the first is to garner enough viewers and to keep them watching, and the second is keep people interested by discussing a wide enough range of issues to compel them to vote. each candidate needs to be at their best, but not too aggressive, because the aggressive candidate always loses in franceâ¦ they will also likely be confronted with a specific problem they need to solve, which will probably be their main weakness. the winning candidateâs ability to succeed in the presidential elections [in may 2017], however, depends on turnout in the primary. if itâs more than three million, theyâll have legitimacy. if itâs less than two million, then their opponents and the media will say that itâs a failure. theyâll be the winner of a competition to hold a castle thatâs collapsing. date created : 2017-01-12

              belgium has charged two suspects with providing false documents to a man linked to the november 2015 paris attacks, who later blew himself up on a crowded brussels metro, federal prosecutors said thursday. the pair, a man and a woman, were ""suspected to have provided khalid bakraoui with the false documents afterwards used in preparation of the paris attacks,"" which were claimed by the islamic state (is) group and killed 130 people, prosecutors said. bakraoui was the suicide bomber at a brussels metro station while his brother ibrahim and another man attacked brussels airport in coordinated suicide attacks that killed 32 people on march 22 last year. belgian press reports said the suspects identified thursday as farid k. and meryem e.b. were the same people who were arrested during an anti-terror raid on a home in the brussels district of laeken on tuesday. farid k. has ""been charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group, falsification of documents and use of false documents,"" the prosecutor's office said.

  meryem e.b. ""has been charged with falsification of documents and use of false documents,"" it said. farid k. has been placed in police custody while meryem e.b was released under ""strict"" conditions, it added. some 20 people have been charged in belgium in connection with the paris attacks. investigators say the paris and brussels attacks were carried out by the same cell. investigators said bakraoui used a false name to rent an apartment in the southern brussels district of forest that was raided one week before the metro and airport bombings. a french woman police officer and three belgian colleagues were wounded in the march 15 shootout at the apartment in which an algerian islamist suspect was killed. police found in the apartment the fingerprints of paris attacks fugitive salah abdeslam, the only known jihadist to have survived the massacres there, and arrested him three days later in central brussels. prosecutors also believe bakraoui used a false name and belgian identity card to rent a flat in the southern belgian city of charleroi which served as a base for the paris attackers.

              president franã§ois hollande stressed franceâs active engagement on the international stage, particularly in syria and the rest of the arab world, in a key foreign policy speech delivered in paris thursday. in his annual foreign policy speech to the foreign diplomatic corps -- his last before he steps down from the presidency in may -- hollande highlighted his administrationâs interventions in a number of crises. âfrance is working in favour of the integrity of countries that are victims of crises,â said hollande, referring to the conflicts in syria and libya. âit would be too easy a solution to ethnicise such territories, to get rid of borders. but that would give terrorists the opportunity to exploit the situation,â he noted. in a sweeping speech that detailed his foreign policy legacy over the past five years, hollande highlighted franceâs engagement in africa â particularly the sahel region â as well as in iraq, libya and syria. but on the syrian crisis, hollande expressed remorse over the international communityâs failure to intervene soon enough to stem a spiraling conflict. harking back to the summer of 2013, when the major western powers did not enforce us president barack obamaâs âred lineâ on the syrian regimeâs use of chemical weapons, hollande said the international community was still paying the price for that disengagement. âthis tragedy has lasted nearly six years. so it has been a failure, a moral failure, a political failure on the part of the international community,â said hollande. âi remain convinced that it would have been possible to put an end to this tragedy much earlier. a key date will remain in the history books as a turning point: the summer of 2013 â¦ it had been proved that chemical weapons had been used by the [syrian] regime. this was the 'red line' which had been set, and the transgression of this red line was not punished as it should have been. france was prepared to intervene at that time â¦ [but] as a result of this international inaction, the worst consequences ensued,â said hollande, noting the rise of the islamic state (is) group, the migrant crisis and the massacre of civilians.

  pushing for peace in the middle east 

hollande also stressed the importance of finding a lasting solution to the israeli-palestinian crisis and reaffirmed franceâs commitment to the two-state solution. on sunday, representatives of around 70 countries are set to attend a middle east peace conference in paris aimed at exploring ways to jumpstart the long-stalled peace process. the objective of the conference, said hollande, was âto reaffirm the international communityâs commitment to the two-state solution.â however hollande was careful to stress that france supported bilateral talks between the israelis and palestinians -- a position israel has recently adopted. âi am very clear about what i can bring to this conference: peace must be made by the israelis and the palestinians, and no one else. only bilateral negotiations can succeed."" but even as hollande was speaking in paris, israeli prime minister benjamin netyanyahu was dismissing sundayâs peace talks. ""it's a rigged conference, rigged by the palestinians with french auspices to adopt additional anti-israel stances,"" netanyahu told reporters in jerusalem. ""this pushes peace backwards. it's not going to obligate us. it's a relic of the past. it's a last gasp of the past before the future sets in."" a veiled warning to trump in his final speech to the diplomatic corps in france before stepping down, hollande also paid tribute to his âfriendshipâ with another outgoing leader, obama, noting their cooperation on major issues such as the iran nuclear deal. although he did not specifically mention donald trump, hollande appeared to be referring to the controversial us president-elect when he warned that france will retain its autonomy in foreign-policy issues. ""france will always be there for the united states, a reliable ally. but i also want to make it clear that we will be autonomous in our choices.â france, he insisted, ""will be able to take, with the freedom that marks us as a nation, positions that can sometimes be different [from those of the us] if we think that they are not in accordance with our interests or values"".

              the franco-american patriarch of the wildenstein art-dealing dynasty was cleared thursday by a paris court of massive tax fraud, in a long-running saga sparked by family battles that had gripped high society watchers.
 the court said there was a ""clear attempt"" by guy wildenstein and seven co-defendants to conceal art treasures and properties worth hundreds of millions of euros from tax authorities. but shortcomings in the investigation and in french legislation on tax fraud made it impossible to return a guilty verdict, presiding judge olivier geron said. the ""powerful and the poor"" have an equal right to justice, he told a packed courtroom. wildenstein, 71, and other members of one of the biggest art-dealing families of the 20th century were accused of using a web of opaque trusts and tax havens to avoid paying tax on the bulk of a multi-billion-euro estate. the allegations first surfaced over a decade ago when various wildenstein widows and ex-wives, feeling shortchanged by the clan, began lifting the lid on its business dealings. french tax authorities claimed the wildensteins owe them some 550 million euros ($580 million) in unpaid inheritance taxes between 2001 and 2008. wildenstein's nephew alec junior, his estranged russian sister-in-law, liouba stoupakova, a notary, two lawyers and two offshore trusts were also tried over their alleged role in the suspected fraud. none of the wildensteins were in court for the ruling. guy wildenstein's lawyer herve temime said his client was ""very relieved"" by the verdict. 'dallas-upon-seine' after a three-week trial last year, dubbed ""dallas-upon-seine"", prosecutors had called for the silver-haired art dealer to be given a two-year prison term and 250 million euro fine for what they called ""the longest and most sophisticated"" tax fraud in modern-day france. the wildensteins have roots in eastern france but during world war ii part of the clan fled to new york, where guy was born. french authorities alleged that on the death of their father daniel in france in 2001, guy and his brother alec began hastily transferring assets from new york to switzerland. the brothers together declared just 40.9 million euros in france for inheritance tax purposes in 2002. to pay the bill, they handed over bas-reliefs sculpted for marie-antoinette, the wife of louis xvi. their stepmother sylvia roth later claimed she had been hoodwinked by the pair into relinquishing her share of the inheritance and successfully sued. the wildensteins argued that there was no legal obligation at the time in france to report trust-held assets. on thursday, the paris court expressed ""astonishment"" that french lawmakers waited until 2011 to pass a law on the taxation of trusts. alec, who ran the family's thoroughbred horse breeding business until his death in 2008, is best remembered for his messy divorce from jocelyn perisse, a swiss cosmetic surgery devotee. their divorce proceedings in the late 1990s provided a first peek inside the eye-popping riches of the secretive wildensteins. after alec's death, guy wildenstein declared an inheritance of $61 million -- an amount seen as conservative given the family's ownership of a trove of works by rococo painter fragonard and post-impressionist bonnard. the estate also includes property, with the jewel in the crown being the game-filled kenyan ranch that served as the setting for the film ""out of africa"". the assets were mainly registered in tax havens in a series of trusts, one of which allegedly holds paintings worth an estimated one billion dollars. during the trial guy claimed he himself was mystified by the labyrinthine tax schemes put in place by his father and older brother. the case caused blushes for former french president nicolas sarkozy, who had made guy wildenstein a commander of the legion of honour in 2009, one of france's highest honours.

              the idea of giving french citizens a universal basic income has become a central issue ahead of the left wing primaries to choose a candidate for this yearâs presidential election. the primaries take place on january 22 and 29.  universal basic income would be funded by tax increases, while (in theory) much of the money handed out would be reinjected into the economy, boosting growth and employment opportunities, while lowering poverty and cutting government red tape by replacing complex and diverse unemployment benefits schemes. âerosion of employmentâ there are seven candidates for januaryâs primaries, with polls putting former prime minister manuel valls in the lead for the first round. however, the same polls show that voting intentions are evenly split in the second round between valls and a handful of leading candidates. >> read more on france24.com: ""who are the candidates in france's left-wing presidential primary?"" one of these front runners, benoit hamon is a firm supporter of a universal basic income, of between 750 and 800 euros a month, which would be paid to every single french citizen aged 18 and over, regardless of whether they are employed or not. hammon, whom polls give a 50-50 chance against valls in a second round, sees the universal basic income as an essential measure given the âprobable erosion of employment as a result of the digital revolutionâ which will see ever more automation of jobs. a âdecent incomeâ for the worst off âi believe in a society that is employed,â centrist arnaud montebourg this week. âwork is what dignifies citizenship.â his view is supported by christian paul, a socialist mpâ who is not running for president: âuniversal basic income would resign us to mass unemployment.â  
        
                    
                
    
  manuel valls said he objected in principle to donating money to everyone from the âfactory worker to [billionaire lâorã©al heiress] liliane bettencourtâ. valls, instead, wants to give a âdecent incomeâ of around 800 euros to franceâs poorest, but is against creating a âsociety of dependence and lazinessâ. massive cost giving each adult french citizen a free handout of 750 euros per month would cost the french state some 450 billion euros a year, or âthe equivalent of the entire state budgetâ, according to montebourg, who said such a project would be âimpossibleâ. hamon believes that the universal basic income could be introduced in stages, starting with young people aged 18-25, âto help them integrate into society and the jobs market, and funded by a wealth tax and an initial state payout of 45 billion euros"". hammon said a basic unemployment benefits scheme (called rsa), currently at 535 euros a month, should be raised immediately to 600 euros and given to all unemployed, whether they apply for it or not (at the moment, one third of people who are eligible for the rsa do not apply for it). finns experiment, swiss reject  on january 1, 2017, finland became the first country in europe to pay its unemployed citizens a basic monthly income in an experiment with 2,000 randomly chosen jobseekers. each will receive 560 euros every month, with no reporting requirements on how they spend it. the amount will be deducted from any benefits they already receive. voters in switzerland strongly defeated a referendum on whether to introduce the measure in 2016, with 77 percent voting against the proposals. date created : 2017-01-12

              franceâs presidential election frontrunner francois fillon vowed on wednesday to take back control of immigration including by imposing quotas on non-european union nationals as he looks to win votes from the far-right national front party. immigration and security are key issues in the campaign for this yearâs vote with the leader of the national front, marine le pen, promising to be tough on immigration, radical islam and to exit the euâs border-free area. fillon is seen beating le pen if they meet in a runoff vote in may in the election and was campaigning on wednesday in south-eastern france, a region where le pen has garnered support largely down to her stance on immigration and islam. âfrance is generous, but it is not a mosaic and a territory without limits. it is one nation that has a right to choose who can join it and a right that foreigners accept its rules and customs,â fillon told a rally of some 2,000 supporters.

  outlining his proposals, the former prime minister said he wanted parliament to adopt annual quotas limiting the number of foreigners admitted to the country based on economic needs and capacity to integrate, a move that he said would discourage entire families from coming to france. âwe have six million unemployed and nearly nine million poor people. immigration must be firmly controlled and reduced to a strict minimum,â he said, adding that he would be ready to revise the constitution and take on european institutions to implement changes. he said he would also deny social benefits to immigrants who have legally resided in france for less than two years. urging the european union to tighten its asylum and immigration policy to counter threats from islamist militants, he said he would cut down the time to process asylum requests and increase the period illegal immigrants could be held in detention centres. >>watch more on france24.com: ""migrants face potentially deadly winter weather in greek camps"" development aid and the allocation of visas for countries would depend on whether illegal immigrants were taken back by their country of origin, he said.
 fillon, who was speaking in nice where 86 people were killed in july in a truck attack claimed by islamic state, did not back an exit from the euâs schengen border-free area. however, he stressed that attacks in europe, most recently in berlin where the assailant was able to travel easily across the continent before being gunned down, showed that schengen needed to be reviewed. âwithin the context of war on islamic totalitarianism, as long as europeâs borders are not protected by our partners, france will re-establish lasting controls at its borders,â he said. fillonâs immigration plans, along with his embrace of free market economic policies, have drawn criticism from rivals on the left who say they will deepen divisions in french society.

 far-right french presidential candidate marine le pen said on tuesday she would seek to repatriate production of french motor vehicles and other industrial goods - just as president-elect donald trump hopes to do in the united states. trump has threatened to slap tariffs on cars made abroad, saying the practice costs american jobs. he has praised ford motor co's decision last week to scrap a plan to build a plant in mexico, and fiat chrysler automobiles' confirmation of plans to create 2,000 jobs at its u.s. factories. asked whether she would like to see the same thing happen with french manufacturers renault and psa peugeot citroen, the national front (fn) leader said: ""he (trump) is putting in place measures i have been demanding for years."" speaking on france 2 television, she described the policy as ""economic patriotism, (and) intelligent protectionism."" ""i don't mind explaining to french companies that they can not escape tax that they should be paying in france, that they cannot go offshore without suffering the consequences ... a choice has to be made, a choice of patriotism. both renault and peugeot have significant cars and parts-making activities in spain and eastern europe. other candidates in france's spring presidential election have praised trump's attitude on ford, including socialist arnaud montebourg and left-wing independent jean-luc melenchon. le pen's protectionist and anti-globalisation agenda has helped win her widespread support in her campaign. most opinion polls show her contesting, but losing, the second and final round of the presidential election in may with francois fillon who represents conservative party the republicans. industrial policy is one of the key differences between the two. fillon has a liberal programme aimed at rolling back state involvement in corporate life. on dec. 1 he advocated selling government holdings in major companies, saying the government's near-20 percent stake in renault was pointless and could not prevent it from building factories abroad.

              former afghan interpreters for the french army organised parallel protests in kabul and paris on tuesday, citing death threats from islamist insurgents and demanding visas. nearly 100 ex-interpreters gathered near the french embassy in the afghan capital, holding banners calling for protection and solidarity from their former employer. the protesters were nevertheless promptly dispersed by local police. ""why are we still here in kabul? why were our demands rejected by the french government?"" asked khodadad adib, 28, a representative of the interpreters.

""we were with the soldiers in sometimes dangerous places. today we find ourselves in a difficult situation, but the army is no longer with us,"" adib explained. the interpreters said they are in danger after working with french troops deployed against the taliban insurgency. habib, who lives with relatives in parwan province north of kabul, said he had received several anonymous letters threatening him and his family with death. ""sometimes i have to wear a burqa to go out on the street and go to work. my father wears a mask to go to the mosque, my brothers do not go to school anymore,"" he said. he said his visa application was refused in 2013, and again in 2015. labelled âtraitorsâ a similar demonstration by afghan interpreters was held in the french capital on tuesday.

shafiq ghorwaln, 33, a former interpreter who has been in france since june, said that in kabul he and fellow interpreters were regularly called âtraitorsâ and âinfidelsâ by other afghans. another man protesting in paris and who asked to remain anonymous said he feared for the safety of his family back home.

âmy brother who stayed in afghanistan constantly receives death threats,â he told france 24. a total of 70,000 french soldiers were deployed in afghanistan between the end of 2001 and the end of 2014, of whom 89 were killed and about 700 wounded. some 700 afghans worked alongside them in jobs ranging from mechanics to interpreters. one hundred of these have benefited from a process of ""relocation"" in france.  others have tried illegal â and often dangerous - emigration routes to france and europe.

              french conservative presidential candidate francois fillon will meet german chancellor angela merkel on january 23 to outline his plans for a europe which he said should focus on defence, security and a tighter euro zone.
 french conservative presidential candidate francois fillon will meet german chancellor angela merkel on january 23 to outline his plans for a europe which he said should focus on defence, security and a tighter euro zone. while europe is rarely much of a factor in french presidential elections, the bloc's future has taken center-stage in recent days, with candidates from the far-right national front, and the mainstream left and right wing parties exposing very different views. ""for the united states, our continent will likely not be a priority anymore and for germany, a certain idea of pacifism is gone,"" said fillon, referring both to the election of donald trump and the berlin truck attack claimed by islamic state. ""france must seize this opportunity to re-mobilise the european union around strategic priorities: our collective security, defence, innovation and the re-tightening of the euro zone,"" said fillon, the favourite in opinion polls for the april and may presidential election. fillon, who did not detail his plans and did not say what he meant by a tighter euro zone, said he would meet merkel in the coming days ""to spell out to her my orientations for europe."" the meeting will take place on january 23 in berlin, an aide said. fillon is viewed by merkel's government as an ally in areas such as economic reform, where he has proposed a shock-and-awe approach involving deep cuts to public spending. but on other issues, from russia and turkey to migration and europe, fillon's views differ to those of merkel, who is seeking a fourth term as german chancellor. fillon, who was addressing journalists and lawmakers, also said he wanted to ""muscle up"" france's defence and move to a more ""imaginative"" foreign policy. fillon, who had already received praise from russian president vladimir putin, was on monday described positively by syrian president bashar al-assad. ""his rhetoric on terrorism, making combating terrorists a priority and not interfering in other countries' business, was welcome,"" assad told french media.

              protesters and politicians have hijacked the trial of a french activist who stole chairs from a bnp bank branch, determined to turn the proceedings into a âcounter-trial of tax evasionâ. hundreds of supporters, some dressed as cigar-smoking bankers, rallied in the southwestern city of dax on monday, calling for the release of environmental activist jon palais, who went on trial for the theft of 14 chairs from a paris bank branch in october 2015. protesters included green party presidential candidate yannick jadot, and renowned farmer activist josã© bovã©. another former presidential candidate, the prominent anti-corruption magistrate eva joly, was also present as part of palaisâs legal team. the chair-stealing stunt was part of a campaign to raise awareness of bankersâ role in aiding and abetting tax evasion. it followed the disclosure of damning documents leaked from banks involved in widespread fraud.

  palais and other activists stole some 200 chairs from dozens of bank branches before the start of the paris climate summit in december 2015. their aim was to show that the fight against global warming could be financed by using the proceeds derived from tax evasion. the chairs were eventually deposited outside the paris court of justice in february 2016, in a move timed to coincide with the start of the high-profile trial of disgraced former budget minister jã©rã´me cahuzac, who had been appointed to clamp down on tax evasion and was instead jailed for tax fraud. palais faces up to five years in prison and 75,000 euros in fines for the âorganised theftâ of chairs, though he is unlikely to go to jail. bnp, one of the worldâs largest banks, has asked for a symbolic compensation of 1 euro. noting that the chairs had been returned, jean-luc puyo, the public prosecutor, called for an âexemption from penaltyâ. he described palaisâs movement as âpacifist and good-naturedâ and lamented the absence in court of representatives of the paris-based bank. date created : 2017-01-10 en direct devant l'entrãâ©e du tribunal pour le procãâ¨s de @jonpalais ! un monde de fou pour dãâ©noncer l'#evasionfiscale ! #pourunechaise pic.twitter.com/cmmu8pfzjdâ bizi !

              paris mayor anne hidalgo fired another shot across the bow at the capitalâs car culture on sunday, in the face of increasing criticism. the socialist mayor, and passionate green advocate, announced plans to ban cars from key thoroughfares around the louvre museum and boost the cityâs cycling infrastructure to combat traffic pollution. hidalgo laid out her vision in the weekly âjournal du dimancheâ newspaper, going so far as to call personal vehicles âarchaic"". âthe idea is to, little by little, move towards the pedestrianisation of downtown, which, over time, will stay open to public transport, police, emergency vehicles and deliveries, but not to all vehicles,â she said. âwe must constantly remember this foregone conclusion: fewer cars, less pollution,â she added.

hidalgo had on friday declared 2017 the âyear of the bikeâ in paris, accelerating a plan to double the city's cycling lanes by 2020. by yearâs end, cyclists will be able to channel their inner chris froome on a new bike path set to run the length of the world famous champs elysã©es, which host the tour de franceâs finish line each year. the socialist mayor plans to halve traffic space on the three-lane rue de rivoli, a key artery through the heart of the city that runs past the louvre museum and alongside the popular tuileries gardens. 'noisy, polluted and dangerous' paris city hall underscored their belief for the need for change by calling the road, ânoisy, polluted, complicated, and even dangerous to cross for pedestrians"". a two-way, four-kilometre bike lane along the rue de rivoli will open in the autumn, linking place de la bastille in the east of the city to place de la concorde in the west. an official handout from city hall illustrates hidalgoâs idea for the ânewâ rue de rivoli, which will be two-way instead of the current one-way. the mayor forecasts that the changes will drastically reduce traffic on a key east-west passage through the city centre just months after the highly contentious closure of the right bankâs iconic seine-side highway in september.

hidalgo had brought the closure of the seine highway to a winning vote despite a non-binding but unfavourable ruling by the public enquiry committee that examined the plan. the backlash to that project, which redirects 43,000 cars a day in order to reclaim the riverbank for pedestrians -- to include âboulesâ pitches, a space for young artists, a fair-trade coffee club and spaces for debates -- spurred an unprecedented backlash from political rivals and car lovers alike. an alliance of 168 exasperated mayors from some of parisâs districts and suburbs, many from the opposition conservative les rã©publicains party, published an open letter attacking hidalgo. âruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of ile-de-france residents to play boules, is that really reasonable?â jean-pierre lecoq, the conservative mayor of parisâs 6th arrondissement (district), tweeted at the time, referring to the residents of the greater paris region, including its suburbs.  the closure of the busy and popular left bank seine-side highway in 2014 had already raised conservativesâ ire. lack of consultation... a stretch of the right bankâs upper quays will get a makeover with 18-to-24-metre-long electric trams set to begin rolling in september 2018, pulling two traffic lanes out of general use over a distance of 11km in the short term. dubbed the âolympic tramway,â the service features in parisâs bid for the 2024 summer olympics, with the french capital bidding against budapest and los angeles. the city of lights has failed three times to win the right to host the olympics -- in 1992, 2008 and 2012. hidalgo has also announced that paris will pedestrianise much of the marais district (an historic popular shopping and nightlife neighbourhood), âin the very short term"". the mayorâs new plan has been slammed for its lack of consultation, a common criticism directed at hidalgo. âonce again, a plan was announced without listening, without prior consultation, just as with the closure of the seine-side highways. the situation is already heavily degraded on the upper right bank quays. if on top of that, bus lanes are added, it will worsen traffic even more,â jean-franã§ois legaret, mayor of parisâs 1st arrondissement (district) told french newspaper le monde.  âon that note, building a two-way cycling lane wonât help anything on the rue de rivoli, which is already bogged down,â added legaret, whose district encompasses the tuileries gardens and the key rue de rivoli thoroughfare. pollution down 30 percent traffic in paris has fallen 30 percent in under 15 years, figures that match the combined terms of hidalgo and her car-battling socialist predecessor bertrand delanoã«. the city says pollution has fallen over that time by a similar level. pollution topped the headlines in december when a so-called âpeak of pollutionâ of a length and magnitude not seen in a decade blanketed the capital, triggering urgent pollution-reduction measures like free public transportation, free street parking and drastic traffic restrictions. despite loud condemnation at home, hidalgoâs green credentials have been lauded abroad. she was recently named âgreen diplomat of the yearâ by us magazine âforeign policyâ and chairs the c40 cities climate leadership group, a network of global megacities working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the mayor is aiming to ban diesel in paris by 2020 and is due to host an international conference in the spring set to bring together mayors of c40 cities and major global automakers, she says. if hidalgoâs record is anything to go by, the mayor wonât be pulling her punches. date created : 2017-01-09

              this week, we explore the social wonders of cooking. good food is good for the body, and making it can be good for the soul. cuisine can connect generations, break down barriers, and give people a purpose in life. we take a look at some initiatives creating a positive social impact through the culinary world. we also talk to french gastronomy star thierry marx (pictured), whose goal is to help disadvantaged youth, former prisoners and the unemployed find jobs and a purpose through cooking.

              this week, we explore the social wonders of cooking. good food is good for the body, and making it can be good for the soul. cuisine can connect generations, break down barriers, and give people a purpose in life. we take a look at some initiatives creating a positive social impact through the culinary world. we also talk to french gastronomy star thierry marx (pictured), whose goal is to help disadvantaged youth, former prisoners and the unemployed find jobs and a purpose through cooking.

              itâs become the hotspot for menswear collections: the basso fort in florence is the place to catch all the new trends. after more than 50 years, pitti uomo is more than a seasonal fashion showcase; itâs one of the vectors of the italian economy. this season weâve seen some incredible work on the use and functionality of high-performance fabrics - including from designer of honour, britain's paul smith. france 24 takes you to check out some of these innovative collections.

              president barack obama delivered a tearful farewell speech tuesday night, thanking the american public for helping make the country a ""better, stronger place"" during his time in office, while warning of the threats facing the nation and its values. addressing the nation for the final time before donald trump takes over the presidency on january 20, a visibly emotional obama started his speech at the mccormick place convention centre in chicago, the city where he began his political career, with a heartfelt thank you to the american people. ""whether we've seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the american people â¦ are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going,"" he said. 

        
            
            peaceful transition 'a hallmark of our democracy'
        
    
    
                                                                                                            
                        
 ""every day, i learned from you. you made me a better president, and you made me a better man."" earlier, as obama had taken the stage, the crowd had erupted into chants of ""four more years"". ""i can't do that,"" a smiling obama replied. call for unity on a busy day in washington, where the senate's grilling of trump's picks for cabinet posts began, and as reports circulated of sensational claims about compromising intelligence held by russia on the president-elect, obama chose to focus on his administration's achievements, including health care reform, marriage equality and economic growth. ""that's what we did. that's what you did. you were the change. you answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, america is a better, stronger place than it was when we started,"" he said. as trump prepares to take office, many of those achievements are now under threat. but, following a bitter and divisive presidential race in which trump defeated the former secretary of state, hillary clinton, obama called on the country to move forward with unity. ""in 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next,"" he said, to boos in the crowd. ""no, no, no, no, no,"" he responded. ""i committed to president-elect trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as president bush did for me. because it's up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face."" 'threat to democracy	' there were several references to trump's policies and rhetoric, as obama warned of the dangers posed by those challenges. trump has frequently voiced scepticism over global warming, and obama warned that the ""faith in reason"" that has been at the heart of us values for centuries is now under threat. he also addressed the fight against global terrorism, arguing that military action must be matched by a defence of ""the values that make us who we are"". ""that's why, for the past eight years, i've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. that's why we've ended torture, worked to close gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties,"" he said. while trump has been accused of enflaming racial tensions with his comments and policy proposals -- including calling for a ban on muslim immigrants and a border wall with mexico -- obama argued that discrimination and racial equality represented a ""threat to our democracy"".

 ""we must uphold laws against discrimination - in hiring, in housing, in education and the criminal justice system. that's what our constitution and highest ideals require,"" he said, adding that ""hearts must change.'' tearful tribute to michelle a sell-out 18,000 crowd turned out to witness obama's final address. they were joined by vice president joe biden and his wife jill, along with the president's wife, michelle, and their daughter, malia. obama called biden ""the first choice i made as a nominee, and the best"" because ""not only have you have been a great vice president, but because in the bargain, i gained a brother"". the most emotional moment of the night came, however, when obama paid tribute to his family. wiping a tear from his eye, he said michelle had been not only ""my wife and mother of my children, but my best friend"" over the past 25 years.

 ""you took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humour,"" he said. ""a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. you've made me proud. you've made the country proud."" his final remarks, however, were to the american people, who he urged to continue the fight to bring about the change he had called for when he first ran for president eight years ago, repurposing his famous campaign line from the time. ""yes we can! yes we did! yes we can!"" he said.

              russiaâs federal banking monitor has launched steps to recover a loan issued in 2014 to the french far-right party, adding to marine le penâs financial woes as she gears up for looming election battles. another election campaign, another frantic fundraising effort for franceâs chronically cash-strapped national front (fn). the eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party had heaved a sigh of relief in september 2014, when it secured a â¬9 million loan from russian lender first czech-russian bank (fcrb). the decision to take out the loan, even as the rest of europe was slapping sanctions on moscow over its actions in ukraine, kicked up a storm in france, where it was widely seen as evidence of le penâs growing coziness with the kremlin. the fn is franceâs only party to have hailed russiaâs annexation of crimea. it regularly praises russian president vladimir putin as a âpatriotâ and a bulwark for traditional european values. but then the russian bank went bust last year, and le pen lost a financial lifeline. according to russian and french media reports, the moscow-based deposit insurance agency (sva), which administers fcrbâs assets and debts, has now started legal proceedings to get the money back. costly ambitions responding to the report, the fnâs treasurer, wallerand de saint-just, said: âthe russian state has taken care of things and there is no reason why the terms of the contract should change.â he told french daily le monde that the fn was due to pay the loan back in a lump sum in september 2019. should russia push for earlier repayment, it could hardly come at a worse time for the far-right party, which is struggling to find the cash needed to fund its campaign for high-stakes elections in the spring.

  le pen is tipped to storm into the second round of franceâs presidential election, and pollsters are refusing to rule out a shock win in may. buoyed by recent successes in regional and european elections, her party is hoping to clinch at least 15 seats in parliament, up from the current two. some experts have said it could win as many as 60. but as the fnâs ambitions have soared, so have its bills. last spring, de saint-just said the party had less than half the â¬40 million required for the campaign. he blamed the shortfall on french banksâ refusal to lend money to the fn, adding that he was forced to apply to 45 foreign banks instead. le pen senior to the rescue complaints about the dearth of french lenders have long been a fixture of the fnâs campaigns â and of what critics describe as its self-victimisation. inevitably, the fnâs foes have pounced on the irony of a nationalist party that is dependent on foreign funds to stay afloat. there are structural reasons for the partyâs chronic funding problems. it has neither enough due-paying members, nor enough due-paying elected officials, to match its ambitions. the countryâs two-round electoral system has long shut it out of office, depriving it of the largest share of public funding. as a result, the fn relies on wealthy donors, and on loans issued by the political fund of le penâs father jean-marie, the partyâs co-founder and longtime leader, to plug the gap. le penâs attempts to detoxify the extremist party have soured relations with her father, who has been repeatedly convicted of inciting racial hatred, eventually leading to his eviction last year. yet despite the highly public spat, the fn confirmed last week it would borrow another â¬6 million from le pen seniorâs fund. eu probe the eurosceptic party's other fundraising efforts have also raised eyebrows in france â and in brussels.

  investigators are currently probing suspicious loans paid to fn candidates by affiliated group âjeanneâ, set up by party leader marine le pen and named after french heroine joan of arc. they suspect that âjeanneâ deliberately overcharged for campaign kits â including posters, flyers and stickers â in order to increase the amount the french state would have to reimburse. under french law, parties that win more than 5 percent of the popular vote in national elections see most of their campaign expenses reimbursed by the state. le penâs party also faces a probe into suspected abuse of eu funds by its sizeable delegation at the european parliament. prosecutors are investigating whether the fn used assistants paid by the european legislature to work on its campaigns in france. olaf, the euâs anti-fraud watchdog, has already asked the european parliament to recover â¬339,000 from le pen as part of the investigation. her party has denied any wrongdoing. date created : 2017-01-05

              a new photo exhibition that opened thursday in paris takes us inside the dwellings of some of the thousands of migrants who set up camp in the âjungleâ of calais, in grande-synthe in northern france and in greece's katsikas. in âitinã©raires intã©rieursâ (interior itineraries), photographer bruno fert takes us inside the makeshift homes that migrants have created while waiting to be granted permanent asylum in the west. with walls bearing the logo of the bradfordâ city football club and a union jack pinned over the bed, one dwelling looks like the room of a typical british teenager. fouad left deraa, syria, in 2015 to try to reach great britain. but like thousands of exiles with the same ambition, his journey was halted in calais at the edge of the english channel. fouad, 26, was in the calais camp for a little more than a year before it was dismantled last october. he lived in one of the wooden shelters built on the site by doctors without borders (mã©decins sans frontiã¨res or msf). fouad has tried to cross the channel several times and once thought he was close to reaching his goal. after clandestinely climbing aboard a truck, he travelled for several hundred hours before discovering that the vehicle was headed to spain. fert fleshes out fouadâs journey with just a few lines of text, but it is the images that really tell his story. in a photograph of the orderly interior where fouad resided for many months, the tranquility that emerges contradicts the usual narrative of misery and chaos commonly associated with âthe jungle"". ""the migrantsâ situation is usually associated with misery, but in the end it is european politicians who have created this misery by blockading people in these places,"" fert said. âwe can see, above all, that these people are well organised, that they are not people who have let anything go.""

  relics of a life left behind    the photo exhibition, which runs until january 15 at the point ephã©mã¨re in paris, seeks to tell the stories of these migrants. fert, in partnership with msf, presents some 15 photographs of the places that have served as temporary homes for the syrian, kurdish, sudanese, pakistani or eritrean migrants detained in the french camps of calais and grande-synthe or in the katsikas camp in greece. the photos are simple but full of detail: a deck of cards abandoned mid-game, cuddly toys laid out on a well-made bed. ""someoneâs dwelling offers information about his standard of living, his financial means, his level of education and his interests,"" said fert. ""in camps like calais, where adversity prevails, the small huts in which migrants live are the last place where they still have some privacy, some gentleness and relics of their past lives."" abdallah, once a grocer in his native afghanistan, naturally set up a small shop in his calais shelter. others have established hairdressing salons or a restaurant such as the three fools, which has become a meeting place for migrants, humanitarians and journalists.

  a kuwaiti bedouin who arrived in france at the age of 18, ali has created a colourful cocoon where spider-man figures rub shoulders with posters of the power rangers. ""he was proud to show off his shelter, because for him it was his first house,"" said fert. ""as a bedouin he had always lived in a tent, and it is as if he has built the childhood room that he never had.""

  mobile phones and barrel ovensâ  although each dwelling remains unique, some objects are found in almost all of them. beds and kitchen utensils, mobile phones, chargers and additional batteries have become indispensable â and not just to call relatives. ""when i asked migrants for family photos, they did not have any but they showed them to me on instagram,"" fert said. ""in reality, migrants do not have many objects from their past lives. to cross the mediterranean it is necessary to travel light â¦ in these houses one mainly sees the objects distributed in the camps.â

  fert said that in katsikas, for example, one migrant served him coffee on an orange tray that was in fact the lid of a kit provided by the un high commission for refugees. in calais, one often found ovens or stoves made from car wheels or barrels. with the dismantling of the jungle, migrants had to leave behind their homes for a second time. ""i was told that some people had burned their houses before leaving, like a farewell ceremonial,â fert said. âi am still in contact with some of the people i photographed, and when they talk about calais there is a lot of nostalgia â it became their capital."" interior itineraries runs from 2pm-7pm until january 15 at the point ephã©mã¨re, 200 quai de valmy, in the 10th arrondissement (district) of paris.

              british intelligence was among the first to raise the alarm over russiaâs hacks of the democratic national committee (dnc), alerting their us counterparts in autumn of 2015, according to us intelligence officials.  us officials who helped prepare the classified government report on russian hacking believe british intelligence was among the first to raise the alarm in autumn of 2015, the new york times reported, citing two people familiar with the reportâs conclusions. the first signs likely came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or agents based outside the united states that picked up on dnc emails and other data being transferred out of the country, the paper said. âthe british picked it up, and we may have had it at about the same time,â one cyber expert, who attended briefings on the reportâs findings, told the times. british intelligence â and particularly its surveillance arm, the government communications headquarters (gchq) â plays a key role in tackling russian cyber threats. when hackers linked to the russian state threatened to disrupt british government agencies and even tv broadcasters ahead of the 2015 uk general election they were thwarted by the gchq. british officials âwere as alarmed as their us counterparts over the extent of contacts between trump advisers and moscow and by trumpâs consistently pro-russian stance on a range of foreign policy issuesâ, the guardian reported. but those officials have now been put in a difficult position as prime minister theresa may seeks to strengthen ties with the incoming us administration, likely in an attempt to offset britainâs increasing international isolation in the wake of the brexit vote. in an interview with sky news on sunday, may said that she had spoken to trump and that the ""special"" relationship between the united states and great britain supercedes the personal affinities of any two leaders. may and trump are scheduled to meet in person sometime in the spring after the latter takes office.

  in november the uk passed the investigatory powers act, which vastly expanded brtiain's surveillance capabilities, much to the dismay of privacy advocates. the law will allow security agencies to hack a personal computer or mobile phone to gather data even if the owner is not suspected of wrongdoing if it is justifiable in the ""interests of national security or of the economic well-being of the united kingdom"". the new law also requires internet providers to keep a record of each website its customers have visited for a year and to surrender browsing histories to the government if requested. bungled response  a declassified report on cyber intrusions at the democratic national committee released on friday revealed that russian intelligence first gained access to dnc networks in july 2015. but it was not until september of that year that the fbi alerted the dnc to the breach. even after a special agent from the fbi contacted the dnc multiple times over several weeks to tell democrats they had been hacked, the committee was slow to respond â the government contractor who received the fbi calls later revealed that he thought the calls might have been a prank. us media reported this week that the fbi has yet to request access to dnc computer servers as part of its investigation into the russian hacks. âthe dnc had several meetings with representatives of the fbiâs cyber division and its washington (dc) field office, the department of justiceâs national security division, and u.s. attorneyâs offices, and it responded to a variety of requests for cooperation, but the fbi never requested access to the dncâs computer servers,â wrote eric walker, the dncâs deputy communications director, in an email to buzzfeed news. the fbi has instead relied on the private cybersecurity firm crowdstrike to conduct computer forensics, a us intelligence official said. the declassified report â jointly released by the cia, the nsa and the fbi on friday â said russian hackers maintained their access to the dnc network from july 2015 âuntil at least june 2016â. the intelligence agencies were unequivocal in their assessment that the hacking orders came from the top: ârussian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the us presidential election.â moreover, they said russia's actions were clearly designed to boost trump's chances while undermining democratic candidate hillary clinton. âputin and the russian government aspired to help president-elect trumpâs election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. all three agencies agree with this judgment,â the report said. russia was also able to hack republican networks, but chose not to release much of the information it had gathered. ârussia collected on some republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign,â the report said. date created : 2017-01-08 i look very much forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in washington in the spring. britain, a longtime u.s. ally, is very special!â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) 8 janvier 2017

              paris mayor anne hidalgo fired another shot across the bow at the capitalâs car culture on sunday, in the face of increasing criticism. the socialist mayor, and passionate green advocate, announced plans to ban cars from key thoroughfares around the louvre museum and boost the cityâs cycling infrastructure to combat traffic pollution. hidalgo laid out her vision in the weekly âjournal du dimancheâ newspaper, going so far as to call personal vehicles âarchaic"". âthe idea is to, little by little, move towards the pedestrianisation of downtown, which, over time, will stay open to public transport, police, emergency vehicles and deliveries, but not to all vehicles,â she said. âwe must constantly remember this foregone conclusion: fewer cars, less pollution,â she added.

hidalgo had on friday declared 2017 the âyear of the bikeâ in paris, accelerating a plan to double the city's cycling lanes by 2020. by yearâs end, cyclists will be able to channel their inner chris froome on a new bike path set to run the length of the world famous champs elysã©es, which host the tour de franceâs finish line each year. the socialist mayor plans to halve traffic space on the three-lane rue de rivoli, a key artery through the heart of the city that runs past the louvre museum and alongside the popular tuileries gardens. 'noisy, polluted and dangerous' paris city hall underscored their belief for the need for change by calling the road, ânoisy, polluted, complicated, and even dangerous to cross for pedestrians"". a two-way, four-kilometre bike lane along the rue de rivoli will open in the autumn, linking place de la bastille in the east of the city to place de la concorde in the west. an official handout from city hall illustrates hidalgoâs idea for the ânewâ rue de rivoli, which will be two-way instead of the current one-way. the mayor forecasts that the changes will drastically reduce traffic on a key east-west passage through the city centre just months after the highly contentious closure of the right bankâs iconic seine-side highway in september.

hidalgo had brought the closure of the seine highway to a winning vote despite a non-binding but unfavourable ruling by the public enquiry committee that examined the plan. the backlash to that project, which redirects 43,000 cars a day in order to reclaim the riverbank for pedestrians -- to include âboulesâ pitches, a space for young artists, a fair-trade coffee club and spaces for debates -- spurred an unprecedented backlash from political rivals and car lovers alike. an alliance of 168 exasperated mayors from some of parisâs districts and suburbs, many from the opposition conservative les rã©publicains party, published an open letter attacking hidalgo. âruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of ile-de-france residents to play boules, is that really reasonable?â jean-pierre lecoq, the conservative mayor of parisâs 6th arrondissement (district), tweeted at the time, referring to the residents of the greater paris region, including its suburbs.  the closure of the busy and popular left bank seine-side highway in 2014 had already raised conservativesâ ire. lack of consultation... a stretch of the right bankâs upper quays will get a makeover with 18-to-24-metre-long electric trams set to begin rolling in september 2018, pulling two traffic lanes out of general use over a distance of 11km in the short term. dubbed the âolympic tramway,â the service features in parisâs bid for the 2024 summer olympics, with the french capital bidding against budapest and los angeles. the city of lights has failed three times to win the right to host the olympics -- in 1992, 2008 and 2012. hidalgo has also announced that paris will pedestrianise much of the marais district (an historic popular shopping and nightlife neighbourhood), âin the very short term"". the mayorâs new plan has been slammed for its lack of consultation, a common criticism directed at hidalgo. âonce again, a plan was announced without listening, without prior consultation, just as with the closure of the seine-side highways. the situation is already heavily degraded on the upper right bank quays. if on top of that, bus lanes are added, it will worsen traffic even more,â jean-franã§ois legaret, mayor of parisâs 1st arrondissement (district) told french newspaper le monde.  âon that note, building a two-way cycling lane wonât help anything on the rue de rivoli, which is already bogged down,â added legaret, whose district encompasses the tuileries gardens and the key rue de rivoli thoroughfare. pollution down 30 percent traffic in paris has fallen 30 percent in under 15 years, figures that match the combined terms of hidalgo and her car-battling socialist predecessor bertrand delanoã«. the city says pollution has fallen over that time by a similar level. pollution topped the headlines in december when a so-called âpeak of pollutionâ of a length and magnitude not seen in a decade blanketed the capital, triggering urgent pollution-reduction measures like free public transportation, free street parking and drastic traffic restrictions. despite loud condemnation at home, hidalgoâs green credentials have been lauded abroad. she was recently named âgreen diplomat of the yearâ by us magazine âforeign policyâ and chairs the c40 cities climate leadership group, a network of global megacities working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the mayor is aiming to ban diesel in paris by 2020 and is due to host an international conference in the spring set to bring together mayors of c40 cities and major global automakers, she says. if hidalgoâs record is anything to go by, the mayor wonât be pulling her punches. date created : 2017-01-09

               The politics of France take place with the framework of a semi-presidential system determined by the French Constitution of the French Fifth Republic. The nation declares itself to be an ""indivisible, secular, democratic, and social Republic"". The constitution provides for a separation of powers and proclaims France's ""attachment to the Rights of Man and the principles of national sovereignty as defined by the Declaration of 1789."" The political system of France consists of an executive branch, a legislative branch and a judicial branch. Executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government. The Government consists of the Prime Minister and ministers. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and is responsible to Parliament. The government, including the Prime Minister, can be revoked by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, through a ""censure motion""; this ensures that the Prime Minister is always supported by a majority of the lower house (which, on most topics, has prominence over the upper house). Parliament comprises the National Assembly and the Senate. It passes statutes and votes on the budget; it controls the action of the executive through formal questioning on the floor of the houses of Parliament and by establishing commissions of inquiry. The constitutionality of the statutes is checked by the Constitutional Council, members of which are appointed by the President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly, and the President of the Senate. Former presidents of the Republic also are members of the Council. The independent judiciary is based upon civil law system which evolved from the Napoleonic codes. It is divided into the judicial branch (dealing with civil law and criminal law) and the administrative branch (dealing with appeals against executive decisions), each with their own independent supreme court of appeal: the Court of Cassation for the judicial courts and the Conseil d'Etat for the administrative courts. The French government includes various bodies that check abuses of power and independent agencies. France is a unitary state. However, its administrative subdivisions—regions, departments and communes—have various legal functions, and the national government is prohibited from intruding into their normal operations. France was a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community, later the European Union. As such, France has transferred part of its sovereignty to European institutions, as provided by its constitution. The French government therefore has to abide by European treaties, directives and regulations.   A popular referendum approved the constitution of the French Fifth Republic in 1958, greatly strengthening the authority of the presidency and the executive with respect to Parliament. The constitution does not contain a bill of rights in itself, but its preamble mentions that France should follow the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, as well as those of the preamble to the constitution of the Fourth Republic. This has been judged to imply that the principles laid forth in those texts have constitutional value, and that legislation infringing on those principles should be found unconstitutional if a recourse is filed before the Constitutional Council. Also, recent modifications of the Constitution have added a reference in the preamble to an Environment charter that has full constitutional value, and a right for citizens to contest the constitutionality of a statute before the Constitutional Council. The foundational principles of the constitution include: the equality of all citizens before law, and the rejection of special class privileges such as those that existed prior to the French Revolution; presumption of innocence; freedom of speech; freedom of opinion including freedom of religion; the guarantee of property against arbitrary seizure; the accountability of government agents to the citizenry. France has a semi-presidential system of government. This means that the presidential candidate is required to obtain a nationwide majority of non-blank votes at either the first or second round of balloting, which implies that the President is somewhat supported by at least half of the voting population. As a consequence, the President is the pre-eminent figure in French politics. He appoints the Prime Minister; though he may not de jure dismiss him, if the Prime Minister is from the same political side, he can, in practice, have him resign on demand (and it is known that Prime Ministers are asked to sign a non-dated dismissal letter before being nominated). He appoints the ministers, ministers-delegate and secretaries. When the President's political party or supporters control parliament, the President is the dominant player in executive action, choosing whomever he wishes for the government, and having it follow his political agenda (parliamentary disagreements do occur, though, even within the same party). However, when the President's political opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and government who reflect the majority in parliament, and who will implement the agenda of the parliamentary majority. When parties from opposite ends of the political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as cohabitation. Before 2002, Cohabitation was more common, because the term of the President was seven years and the term of the National Assembly was five years. Now that the term of the President has been shortened to five years, and that the elections are separated by only a few months, this is less likely to happen. Nicolas Sarkozy became President on 16 May 2007, succeeding Jacques Chirac. Francois Hollande became President in 2012, succeeding Nicolas Sarkozy. The government is led by the Prime Minister, and is made up of junior and senior ministers. It has at its disposal the civil service, government agencies, and the armed forces. The government is responsible to Parliament, and the National Assembly may pass a motion of censure, forcing the resignation of the government. This, in practice, forces the government to be from the same political party or coalition as the majority in the Assembly. Ministers have to answer questions from members of Parliament, both written and oral; this is known as the questions au gouvernement (questions to the government). In addition, ministers attend meetings of the houses of Parliament when laws pertaining to their areas of responsibility are being discussed. Government ministers cannot pass legislation without parliamentary approval, though the Prime Minister may issue autonomous regulations or subordinated regulations (décrets d'application) provided they do not infringe on the Parliament domain, as detailed in the constitution. Ministers, however, can propose legislation to Parliament; since the Assembly is usually politically allied to the ministers, such legislation is, in general, very likely to pass. However, this is not guaranteed, and, on occasion, the opinion of the majority parliamentarians may differ significantly from those of the executive, which often results in a large number of amendments. The Prime Minister can engage the responsibility of his government on a law, under article 49-3 of the Constitution. The law is then considered adopted unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, in which case the law is refused and the government has to resign. As of 2006, the last time this article was invoked was for the ""First Employment Contract"" proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, a move that greatly backfired. Traditionally, the government comprises members of three ranks. Ministers are the most senior members of the government; deputy ministers (ministres délégués) assist ministers in particular areas of their portfolio; ministers of state (secrétaires d'État) assist ministers in less important areas, and attend government meetings only occasionally. Before the Fifth Republic, some ministers of particular political importance were called ""secretaries of state"" (ministres d'État); the practice has continued under the Fifth Republic in a purely honorific fashion: ministers styled Secretary of State are supposed to be of a higher importance in the gouvernement. The number of ministries and the division of responsibilities and administrations between them varies from government to government. While the name and exact responsibility of each ministry may change, one generally finds at least: (For more on French ministries, see French government ministers) The government has a leading role in shaping the agenda of the houses of Parliament. It may propose laws to Parliament, as well as amendments during parliamentary meetings. It may make use of some procedures to speed up parliamentary deliberations. The government has weekly meetings (usually on Wednesday mornings), chaired by the President, at the Élysée Palace. Following the election of François Hollande as President, Jean-Marc Ayrault replaced François Fillon as the French Prime Minister on 15 May 2012. On 1 April 2014 Manuel Valls became Prime Minister. The French executive has a limited power to establish regulation or legislation. (See below for how such regulations or legislative items interact with statute law.) Only the President and Prime Minister sign decrees (décrets), which are akin to US executive orders. Decrees can only be taken following certain procedures and with due respect to the constitution and statute law. The individual ministers issue ministerial orders (arrêtés) in their fields of competence, subordinate to statutes and decrees. Contrary to a sometimes used polemical cliché, that dates from the third republic, with its decrees-law (décrets-lois), neither the President nor the Prime Minister may rule by decree (outside of the narrow case of presidential emergency powers). The executive cannot issue decrees in areas that the Constitution puts under the responsibility of legislation, issued by Parliament. Still, Parliament may, through a habilitation law, authorize the executive to issue ordinances (ordonnances), with legislative value, in precisely defined areas. Habilitation laws specify the scope of the ordinance. After the ordinance is issued, Parliament is asked whether it wants to ratify it. If Parliament votes no to ratification, the ordinance is cancelled. Most of the time, ratification is made implicitly or explicitly through a Parliament act that deals with the subject concerned, rather than by the ratification act itself. The use of ordinances is normally reserved for urgent matters, or for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in French Francs to Euros in the various laws in force in France). There is also a practice to use ordinances to transpose European Directives into French law, to avoid late transposition of Directive, which is often happening and is criticized by the EU Commission. Ordinances are also used to codify law into codes, to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. They are also sometimes used to push controversial legislation through, such as when Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin created new forms of work contracts in 2005. The use of ordinances in such contexts is then criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament. It must be said, however, that since the National Assembly can dismiss the government through a motion of censure, the government necessarily relies on a majority in Parliament, and this majority would be likely to adopt the controversial law anyway. The general rule is that government agencies and the civil service are at the disposal of the government. However, various agencies are independent agencies (autorités administratives indépendantes) that have been statutorily excluded from the executive's authority, although they belong in the executive branch. These independent agencies have some specialized regulatory power, some executive power, and some quasi-judicial power. They are also often consulted by the government or the French Parliament seeking advice before regulating by law. They can impose sanctions that are named ""administrative sanctions"" sanctions administratives. However, their decisions can still be contested face to a judicial court or an administrative court. Some examples of independent agencies: Public media corporations should not be influenced in their news reporting by the executive in power, since they have the duty to supply the public with unbiased information. For instance, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) is an independent public corporation. Its resources must come solely from its commercial sales. The majority of the seats in its board are held by representatives of the French press. The government also provides for watchdogs over its own activities; these independent administrative authorities are headed by a commission typically composed of senior lawyers or members of the Parliament. Each of the two chambers of the Parliament often has its own commission, but sometimes they collaborate to create a single Commission nationale mixte paritaire. For example: In addition, the duties of public service limit the power that the executive has over the French Civil Service. For instance, appointments, except for the highest positions (the national directors of agencies and administrations), must be made solely on merit or time in office, typically in competitive exams. Certain civil servants have statuses that prohibit executive interference; for instance, judges and prosecutors may be named or moved only according to specific procedures. Public researchers and university professors enjoy academic freedom; by law, they enjoy complete freedom of speech within the ordinary constraints of academia. The government also provides specialized agencies for regulating critical markets or limited resources, and markets created by regulations. Although, as part of the administration, they are subordinate to the ministers, they often act with high independence. Each ministry has a central administration (administration centrale), generally divided into directorates. These directorates are usually subdivided into divisions or sub-directorates. Each direction is headed by a director, named by the President in Council. The central administration largely stays the same regardless of the political tendency of the executive in power. In addition, each minister has a private office, which is composed of members whose nomination is politically determined, called the cabinet. They are quite important and employ numbers of highly qualified staff to follow all the administrative and political affairs. They are powerful, and have been sometimes considered as a parallel administration, especially, but not only, in all matters that are politically sensitive. Each cabinet is led by a chief of staff named directeur de cabinet. The state also has distributive services spread throughout French territory, often reflecting divisions into régions or départements. The prefect, the representative of the national government in each région or département, supervises the activities of the distributive services in his or her jurisdiction. Generally, the services of a certain administration in a région or département are managed by a high-level civil servant, often called director, but not always; for instance, the services of the Trésor public (Treasury) in each département are headed by a treasurer-paymaster general, appointed by the President of the Republic. In the last several decades, the departmental conseil général (see ""Local Government"" below) has taken on new responsibilities and plays an important role in administrating government services at the local level. The government also maintains public establishments. These have a relative administrative and financial autonomy, to accomplish a defined mission. They are attached to one or more supervising authorities. These are classified into several categories: One essential difference is that in administrations and public establishments of an administrative character operate under public law, while establishments of an industrial and commercial character operate mostly under private law. A consequence is that in the former, permanent personnel are civil servants, while normally in the latter, they are contract employees. In addition, the government still owns and controls all, or the majority, of shares of some companies, like Electricité de France, SNCF or Areva. Social security organizations, though established by statute and controlled and supervised by the state, are not operated nor directly controlled by the national government. Instead, they are managed by the ""social partners"" (partenaires sociaux) – unions of employers such as the MEDEF and unions of employees. Their budget is separate from the national budget. The Parliament of France, making up the legislative branch, consists of two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate; the Assembly is the pre-eminent body. Parliament meets for one nine-month session each year: under special circumstances the President can call an additional session. Although parliamentary powers have diminished from those existing under the Fourth Republic, the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an absolute majority of the total Assembly membership votes to censure. It has never happened since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958. The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. The government also can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced (within 24 hours after the proposal) and passed (within 48 hours of introduction – thus full procedures last at most 72 hours), the text is considered adopted without a vote. Members of Parliament enjoy parliamentary immunity. Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary enquiry commissions with broad investigative power. The National Assembly is the principal legislative body. Its 577 deputies are directly elected for five-year terms in local majority votes, and all seats are voted on in each election. The National Assembly may force the resignation of the government by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the Prime Minister and their government are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as cohabitation. While motions of censure are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the government is never overthrown by the Assembly. Senators are chosen by an electoral college of about 145,000 local elected officials for six-year terms, and half of the Senate is renewed every three years. Before the law of 30 July 2004, senators were elected for nine years, renewed by thirds every three years. There are currently 321 senators, but there will be 346 in 2010; 304 represent the metropolitan and overseas départements, five the other dependencies and 12 the French established abroad. The Senate's legislative powers are limited; on most matters of legislation, the National Assembly has the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses. Since the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the Senate has always had a right-wing majority. This is mostly due to the over-representation of small villages compared to big cities. This, and the indirect mode of election, prompted socialist Lionel Jospin, who was Prime Minister at the time, to declare the Senate an ""anomaly"". Statute legislation may be proposed by the government (council of ministers), or by members of Parliament. In the first case, it is a projet de loi; in the latter case, a proposition de loi. All projets de loi must undergo compulsory advisory review by the Conseil d'État before being submitted to parliament. Since 2009, the bill submitted to Parliament must also come with a study of the possible impact of the law: other possible options, interactions with European law, economical, social, financial and environmental consequences. Propositions de loi cannot increase the financial load of the state without providing for funding. Projets de loi start in the house of the government's choice (except in some narrow cases). Propositions de loi start in the house where they originated. After the house has amended and voted on the text, it is sent to the other house, which can also amend it. If the houses do not choose to adopt the text in identical terms, it is sent before a commission made of equal numbers of members of both houses, which tries to harmonize the text. If it does not manage to do so, the National Assembly can vote the text and have the final say on it (except for laws related to the organization of the Senate). The law is then sent to the President of France for signature. At this point, the President of France, the speaker of either house or a delegation of 60 deputies or 60 senators can ask for the text to undergo constitutional review before being put into force; it is then sent before the Constitutional Council. The President can also, only once per law and with the countersigning of the Prime Minister, send the law back to parliament for another review. Otherwise, the President must sign the law. After being countersigned by the Prime Minister and the concerned ministers, it is then sent to the Journal Officiel for publication. Financing Acts (lois de finances) and the Social Security Financing Acts (lois de financement de la sécurité sociale) are special Acts of Parliament voted and approved through specific procedures. Because of the importance of allowing government and social security organizations to proceed with the payment of their suppliers, employees, and recipients, without risk of a being stopped by parliamentary discord, these bills are specially constrained. In the past, parliamentarians would often add unrelated amendments (cavaliers budgétaires) to the finance bills, to get such amendments passed – because of the reduced time in which the budget is examined. However, these are nowadays considered unconstitutional. If Parliament cannot agree on a budget within some specified reasonable bounds, the government is entitled to adopt a budget through ordinances: this threat prevents parliamentarians from threatening to bankrupt the executive. The way the Finance Bill is organized, and the way the government has to execute the budget, were deeply reformed in 2001 by the Loi organique n°2001-692 du 1er août 2001 relative aux lois de finances, generally known as the LOLF. Because of the major changes involved, the application of the law was gradual, and the first budget to be fully passed under LOLF will be the 2006 budget, passed in late 2005. The LOLF divides expenses according to identifiable ""missions"" (which can be subdivided into sub-missions etc.). The performance of the administration and public bodies will be evaluated with respect to these missions. The budget of the national government was forecast to be 290 billion Euro in 2011. This includes neither Social Security, nor the budgets of local governments. It has long been customary for Parliament members to hold, in addition to the office of deputy or senator, another local office such as city mayor, hence titles like ""Deputy and Mayor"" (député-maire) and ""Senator and Mayor"" (sénateur-maire). This is known as the cumul of electoral offices. Proponents of the cumul allege that having local responsibilities ensures that members of parliament stay in contact with the reality of their constituency; also, they are said to be able to defend the interest of their city etc. better by having a seat in parliament. In recent years, the cumul has been increasingly criticized. Critics contend that lawmakers that also have some local mandate cannot be assiduous to both tasks; for instance, they may neglect their duties to attend parliamentary sittings and commission in order to attend to tasks in their constituency. The premise that holders of dual office can defend the interest of their city etc. in the National Parliament is criticized in that national lawmakers should have the national interest in their mind, not the advancement of the projects of the particular city they are from. Finally, this criticism is part of a wider criticism of the political class as a cozy, closed world in which the same people make a long career from multiple positions. As a consequence, laws that restrict the possibilities of having multiple mandates have been enacted. The Economic and Social Council is a consultative assembly. It does not play a role in the adoption of statutes and regulations, but advises the lawmaking bodies on questions of social and economic policies. The executive may refer any question or proposal of social or economic importance to the Economic and Social Council. The Economic and Social Council publishes reports, which are sent to the Prime Minister, the National Assembly and the Senate. They are published in the Journal Official. French law provides for a separate judicial branch with an independent judiciary which does not answer to or is directly controlled by the other two branches of government. France has a civil law legal system, the basis of which is codified law; however, case law plays a significant role in the determination of the courts. The most distinctive feature of the French judicial system is that it is divided into judicial and administrative streams. The judicial stream of courts adjudicates civil and criminal cases. The judicial court stream consists of inferior courts, intermediate appellate courts, and the French Supreme Court. Judges are government employees but are granted special statutory protection from the executive. Judges have security of tenure and may not be promoted (or demoted) without their consent. Their careers are overseen by the Judicial Council of France. The public prosecutors, on the other hand, take orders from the Minister of Justice. In the past, this has bred suspiscion of undue political pressure to dismiss suits or claims against government officials charged with corruption, and the status of public prosecutors and their ties to government are frequently topics of debate. Trial by jury is available only for severe criminal cases, which are the jurisdiction of the Courts of Assizes. A full Court is made up of a 3-judge panel and a petty jury of 9 jurors (vs. 12 jurors on appeal), who, together, render verdicts, and if a conviction is handed down, also determine a sentence. Jurors are selected at random from eligible voters. In most other courts, judges are professional, except that the criminal court for minors is composed of one professional and two lay judges. Also, several specialty courts of original jurisdiction are sat by judges who are elected into office. For instance, labor tribunals are staffed with an equal number of magistrates from employers' unions and employees' unions. The same applies to land estate tribunals. Pre-trial proceedings are inquisitorial by nature, but open court proceedings are adversarial. The burden of proof in criminal proceedings is on the prosecution, and the accused is constitutionally presumed innocent until proven guilty. Courts of administrative law adjudicate on claims and suits against government offices and agencies. The administrative stream is made up of administrative courts, courts of administrative appeal, and the Council of State as the court of last resort. The Council of State hears cases against executive branch decisions and has the power to quash or set aside executive-issued statutory instruments such as orders and regulations when they violate constitutional law, enacted legislation, or codified law. Court proceedings mostly involve written hearings and are inquisitorial, with judges having the parties submit written testimony or arguments. Any jurisdictional dispute between the judicial and administrative streams are settled by a special court called Tribunal des conflits, or ""Court of Jurisdictional Dispute"", composed of an equal number of Supreme Court justices and councillors of State. Neither judicial nor administrative courts are empowered to rule on the constitutionality of acts of Parliament. While technically not part of the judicial branch, the Constitutional Council examines legislation and decides whether or not it violates the Constitution. This applies, prior to their enactment, to all forms of organic laws, but only by referral from the French President, President of the Senate, President of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, or any of the 60 senators or 60 assembly members of the other types of laws or treaties. After their enactment, laws can all be reviewed by referral from the highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, or by the highest judicial court, the Cour de Cassation. The Constitutional Council may declare acts to be unconstitutional, even if they contradict the principles of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (cited in the Preamble of the Constitution). Council members to the Constitutional Council are appointed for nine years (three every three years); three are appointed by the President, three by the President of the National Assembly, and three by the President of the Senate. The former presidents are also members for life of the Constitutional Council. France's main Court of Audit (Cour des Comptes) and regional audit courts audit government finances, public institutions (including other courts), and public entities. The court publishes an annual report and can refer criminal matters to public prosecutors. It can also directly fine public accountants for mishandling funds, and refer civil servants who misused funds to the Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline. The main and regional audit courts do not judge the accountants of private organizations. However, in some circumstances, they may audit their accounting, especially when an organization has been awarded a government contract over a public utility or a service requiring the permanent use of the public domain or if an organization is a bidder on a government contract. The Court is often solicitated by various state agencies, parliamentary commissions, and public regulators, but it can also petitioned to act by any French citizen or organization operating in France. The Court's finances are overseen by financial commissions of the two Houses of the French Parliament which also set the Court's working budget in the annual Act of finances. In 1973 the position of médiateur de la République (the Republic's ombudsman) was created. The ombudsman is charged with solving, without the need to a recourse before the courts, the disagreements between citizens and the administrations and other entities charged with a mission of a public service; proposing reforms to the Government and the administrations to further these goals; and actively participating in the international promotion of human rights. The ombudsman is appointed for a period of 6 years by the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers. He cannot be removed from office and is protected for his official actions by an immunity similar to parliamentary immunity. He does not receive or accept orders from any authority. The current ombudsman is Jean-Paul Delevoye. France uses a civil law system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law). Many fundamental principles of French Law were laid in the Napoleonic Codes. Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code: laws can only address the future and not the past (ex post facto laws are prohibited); to be applicable, laws must have been officially published (see Journal Officiel). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the general rule is that of freedom, and law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, said about what should be the rule in French law: That is, law may lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy. France does not recognize religious law, nor does it recognize religious beliefs as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1789). French law differentiates between legislative acts (loi), generally passed by the legislative branch, and regulations (règlement, instituted by décrets), issued by the Prime Minister. There also exist secondary regulation called arrêtés, issued by ministers, subordinates acting in their names, or local authorities; these may only be taken in areas of competency and within the scope delineated by primary legislation. There are also more and more regulations issued by independent agencies, especially relating to economic matters. According to the Constitution of France (article 34): Statutes shall concern: Statutes shall likewise determine the rules concerning: Statutes shall determine the fundamental principles of: Finance Acts shall determine the resources and obligations of the State in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act. Social Security Finance Acts shall determine the general conditions for the financial balance of Social Security and, in light of their revenue forecasts, shall determine expenditure targets in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act. Programme Acts shall determine the objectives of the economic and social action of the State. The provisions of this article may be enlarged upon and complemented by an organic law. Other areas are matters of regulation. This separation between law and regulation is enforced by the Conseil constitutionnel: the government can, with the agreement of the Conseil constitutionnel, modify by decrees the laws that infringe on the domain of regulations. At the same, the Conseil d'État nullifies decrees that infringe on the domain of the law. When courts have to deal with incoherent texts, they apply a certain hierarchy: a text higher in the hierarchy will overrule a lower text. The general rule is that the Constitution is superior to laws which are superior to regulations. However, with the intervention of European law and international treaties, and the quasi-case law of the administrative courts, the hierarchy may become somewhat unclear. The following hierarchy of norms should thus be taken with due caution: Traditionally, decision-making in France is highly centralized, with each of France's departments headed by a prefect appointed by the central government, in addition to the conseil général, a locally elected council. However, in 1982, the national government passed legislation to decentralize authority by giving a wide range of administrative and fiscal powers to local elected officials. In March 1986, regional councils were directly elected for the first time, and the process of decentralization has continued, albeit at a slow pace. In March 2003, a constitutional revision has changed very significantly the legal framework towards a more decentralized system and has increased the powers of local governments. Albeit France is still one of the most centralized major countries in Europe and the world. Administrative units with a local government in Metropolitan France (that is, the parts of France lying in Europe) consist of: The conseil général is an institution created in 1790 by the French Revolution in each of the newly created departments (they were suppressed by the Vichy government from 1942 to 1944). A conseiller général (departmental councillor) must be at least 21 years old and either live or pay taxes in locality from which he or she is elected. (Sociologist Jean Viard noted  that half of all conseillers généraux were still fils de paysans, i.e. sons of peasants, suggesting France's deep rural roots). Though the central government can theoretically dissolve a conseil général (in case of a dysfunctional conseil), this has happened only once in the Fifth Republic. The conseil général discusses and passes laws on matters that concern the department; it is administratively responsible for departmental employees and land, manages subsidized housing, public transportation, and school subsidies, and contributes to public facilities. It is not allowed to express ""political wishes."" The conseil général meets at least three times a year and elects its president for a term of 3 years, who presides over its ""permanent commission,"" usually consisting of 5-10 other departmental councillors elected from among their number. The conseil général has accrued new powers in the course of the political decentralization that has occurred past in France during the past thirty years. There are in all more than 4,000 conseillers généraux in France. Different levels of administration have different duties, and shared responsibility is common; for instance, in the field of education, communes run public elementary schools, while départements run public junior high schools and régions run public high schools, but only for the building and upkeep of buildings; curricula and teaching personnel are supplied by the national Ministry of Education. The 3 main cities, Paris, Lyon and Marseille have a special statute. Paris is at the same time a commune and a département with an institution, the Conseil de Paris, that is elected at the same time as the other conseil municipaux, but that operates also as a conseil général. The 3 cities are also divided into arrondissement each having its conseil d'arrondissement and its mayor. French overseas possessions are divided into two groups: All inhabited French territory is represented in both houses of Parliament and votes for the presidential election. All texts in French unless otherwise noted.  France has a multi-party political system, that is to say one in which the number of competing political parties is sufficiently large as to make it almost inevitable that in order to participate in the exercise of power any single party must be prepared to negotiate with one or more others with a view to forming electoral alliances and/or coalition agreements. The dominant French political parties are also characterized by a noticeable degree of intra-party factionalism, making each of them effectively a coalition in itself. Since the 1980s, the government of France has alternated between two rather stable coalitions: It is difficult for parties outside these two major coalitions to make significant inroads, although the National Front has had sizable successes. Since 2014, the FN has established itself as the third sizable party, finishing in 1st place in the 2014 European elections as well as in the 2015 local elections, although it still didn't manage to win any executives mostly due to the last-ditch alliance between the center-left and the center-right coalitions in Hauts-de-France region as well as in the South of France. Now many political observers talk about the ""tripartisme"" (English: tripartism) of the French political landscape.   (with past or present representation in at least a regional council) Note: Many of the parties in French oversea possessions have strong ties to counterparts in Metropolitan France.  The Government of the French Republic (French: Gouvernement de la République française) exercises executive power. It is composed of a prime minister, who is the head of government, and both junior and senior ministers. Senior ministers are titled as Ministers (French: Ministres), whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State (French: Secrétaires d'État). A smaller and more powerful executive body, called the Council of Ministers (French: Conseil des ministres), is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President of the Republic, unlike the government, but is still led by the Prime Minister, who was officially titled as the President of the Council of Ministers (French: Président du Conseil des ministres) during the Third and Fourth Republics. By comparison, the Government of France is equivalent to Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, whereas the Council of Ministers is equivalent to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.   All members of the French government are nominated by the, President of the Republic on the advice of the Prime Minister. Members of the government are ranked in a precise order, which is established at the time of government formation. In this hierarchy, the Prime Minister is the head of government. He is nominated by the President of the Republic. Whilst the President is constitutionally free to nominate whoever he likes, in practice he must nominate a candidate that reflects the will of the majority of the National Assembly, as the government is responsible to parliament. After being nominated to lead a government, the Prime Minister nominee must propose a list of ministers to the President. The President can either accept or reject these proposed ministers. Ministers are ranked by importance: According to the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic, the government directs and decides the policy of the nation. In practice, the government writes bills to be introduced to parliament, and also writes and issues decrees. All political decisions made by the government must be registered in the government gazette. All bills and some decrees must be approved by the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, it is the Council of Ministers that defines the collective political and policy direction of the government, and takes practical steps to implement that direction. In addition to writing and implementing policy, the government is responsible for national defence, and directs the actions of the French Armed Forces. The workings of the government of France are based on the principle of collegiality. Meetings of the Council of Ministers take place every Wednesday morning at the Élysée Palace. They are presided over by the President of the Republic, who promotes solidarity and collegiality amongst government ministers. These meetings follow a set format. In the first part of a meeting, the Council deliberates over general interest bills, ordinances, and decrees. In the second part, the Council discusses individual decisions by each Minister regarding the appointment of senior civil servants. In the third part, usually either one Minister will give a presentation about some reform or project that he or she is directing, or the President will ask for advice on some subject from the Ministers. In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs provides the Council with weekly updates on important international issues. Most government work, however, is done elsewhere. Much of it is done by each individual ministry, under the direction of the Minister responsible for that ministry. Ministers each have their own staff, called a ""ministerial cabinet"" (French: Cabinet ministériel). Each ministerial cabinet consists of around ten to twenty members, who are political appointees. Cabinet members assist the Minister in running a ministry. Members of ministerial cabinets are powerful figures within the government, and work in both the political and administrative spheres. The hierarchy in each ministerial cabinet is determined by the Minister. Working groups consisting of representatives from several ministries are commonplace. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to oversee these inter-ministry meetings, and to ensure that governmental work is done effectively and efficiently. The government is responsible for the economic and financial policy of the French Republic, must authorise all expenditures made by each ministry, and also manage all revenue. Expenditures are made through what is called a ""finance law"" (French: Loi des Finances), which is equivalent to an appropriation bill. Each minister must prepare a list of requests for funds annually, and submit it to the Budget Ministry. This ministry decides whether to grant or deny requests for funding by ministers. The ministry also calculates the state budget for the coming year. The parliament must vote on all applications of finance law. Members of the French Government cannot occupy any position of occupational or trade leadership at the national level, any public employment, or any professional activity. These restrictions are in place to alleviate external pressure and influence on ministers, and to enable them to focus on their governmental work. Despite these restrictions, members of government are allowed to keep local elected positions, such as those of city mayor or regional councillor. Whilst the Constitution of the French Republic does not prohibit ministers from being the leader of a political party, it is customary that ministers should not occupy such a post. The government is responsible to the French Parliament. In particular, the government must assume responsibility for its actions before the National Assembly, and the National Assembly can dismiss the government with a motion of censure. The government cannot function during the tenure of an acting (interim) president, as that position is granted either to the President of the Senate or the Prime Minister, compromising separation of powers. If the government decides to launch an armed operation with a duration of longer than four months, it must first consult parliament and request an authorisation. The Prime Minister may convene parliament for extraordinary sessions, or add additional sitting days to the legislative calendar. The names of ministries change often in France. This is a list of currently extant ministries:  The first round of the 2017 French presidential election will be held on 23 April 2017. Should no candidate win a majority, a run-off election between the top two candidates will be held on 7 May 2017. Incumbent president François Hollande of the Socialist Party is eligible to run for a second term, but declined to do so on 1 December 2016. The Socialist Party will hold the first round of its presidential primaries on 22 January 2017. According to opinion polls, the current front-runners are former Prime Minister François Fillon for The Republicans, Marine Le Pen for the National Front, and former Minister for the Economy Emmanuel Macron for the new En Marche! organisation.    It has not yet been confirmed if the Democratic Movement (Mouvement démocrate) will contest this presidential election. Bayrou has indicated that he may not decide on whether to run until January or even early February. En Marche! (""Forward!"") was formed by former Minister of the Economy in April 2016. The candidate for France Arise (Debout la France), Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, also contested the last presidential election. Europe Ecology – The Greens selected Yannick Jadot The New Anticapitalist Party (Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste) candidate also contested the previous presidential election In May 2015, the Union for a Popular Movement changed its name to The Republicans (Les Républicains) . The Socialist Party (Parti socialiste) will hold its primary on 22 January 2017, with a runoff election to be held on 29 January between the two candidates with the most votes should no candidate win a majority of the vote. On 1 December 2016, President François Hollande of the Socialist Party announced he will not run for a second and final term. The decision is historic, but not completely unexpected due to his low approval ratings. In his announcement, Hollande stated that he did not want to further divide the left. Hollande had also previously suggested that he may not stand for re-election if he fails to reduce the French unemployment rate by the end of his term. He stated this point again in February 2015, saying that ""if after five years, a President cannot meet the objective that he had when he got elected, he cannot be once more a candidate for the highest office in the country"".

He is the President-elect of the United States and is scheduled to take office as the 45th President on January 20, 2017. Born and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump received an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971, he took charge of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated, and managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name in the branding of various products. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show on NBC. As of 2016, Forbes listed him as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States), with a net worth of $4.5 billion. Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election, and quickly emerged as the front-runner among 17 contenders in the Republican primaries. His final opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention along with Mike Pence as his running mate. His campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016 against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. At age 70, he will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or governmental service, and the fifth elected with less than a plurality of the national popular vote. Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the Internal Revenue Code (tax code) while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. He advocates a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, ""extreme vetting"" of Muslim immigrants to preempt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIS. His positions have been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Jamaica, Queens, a neighborhood in New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Christ ""Fred"" Trump (1905–1999) and Mary Anne Trump (née MacLeod, 1912–2000). His siblings are Maryanne, Fred Jr., Elizabeth, and Robert. Trump's older brother Fred Jr. died in 1981 from alcoholism, which Trump says led him to abstain from alcohol and cigarettes. Trump is of paternal German ancestry and maternal Scottish ancestry. His mother and all his grandparents were born in Europe. His paternal grandparents were immigrants from Kallstadt, Germany, and his father, who became a New York City real estate developer, was born in the Bronx. His mother emigrated to New York from her birthplace of Tong, Lewis, Scotland. Fred and Mary met in New York and married in 1936, raising their family in Queens. His uncle, John G. Trump, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1936 to 1973, was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and helped design X-ray machines that prolonged the lives of cancer patients; in 1943, the Federal Bureau of Investigation requested John Trump examine Nikola Tesla's papers and equipment when Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel. Donald Trump's grandfather was Frederick Trump, who amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the region of Seattle and Klondike, Canada. The Trump family were originally Lutherans, but Trump's parents belonged to the Reformed Church in America. The family name, which was formerly spelled Drumpf, was changed to Trump during the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century. Trump has said that he is proud of his German heritage; he served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City. Trump's family had a two-story mock Tudor home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, where he lived while attending The Kew-Forest School. He left the school at age 13 and was enrolled in the New York Military Academy (NYMA), in Cornwall, New York, where he finished eighth grade and high school. Trump was an energetic child; his parents hoped that the discipline at the military school would allow him to channel his energy in a positive manner. In 1983, Fred Trump told an interviewer that Donald ""was a pretty rough fellow when he was small"". Trump participated in marching drills, wore a uniform, and during his senior year attained the rank of captain. He was transferred from a student command position after the alleged hazing of a new freshman in his barracks by one of Trump's subordinates; Trump later described the transfer as ""a promotion"". In 2015, he told a biographer that NYMA gave him ""more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military"". Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years, beginning in August 1964. He then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, which offered one of the few real estate studies departments in United States academia at the time. While there, he worked at the family's company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, named for his paternal grandmother. He graduated from Penn in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War. While in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments. In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board, but was given a 1-Y medical deferment in October 1968. In an interview for a 2015 biography, he attributed his medical deferment to heel spurs. In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which would also have likely exempted him from service. In 1971 Trump took over the family real estate firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which he renamed The Trump Organization. He greatly expanded its real estate operations as well as ventures into numerous other business activities. It eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships. When Trump was elected president in November 2016, the question arose what he would do with his business activities to avoid conflicts of interest while president. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said he and his daughter Ivanka will resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two oldest sons Don Jr. and Eric run the business, together with existing Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg. Trump himself will retain his financial stake in the business. His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration Trump will put the business assets into a trust, which will hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that the Trump Organization will not pursue any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities. Prior to graduating from college, Trump began his real estate career at his father's company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. During his undergraduate study, Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, used a $500,000 investment to successfully reopen the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio. After being promoted to president of the company in the early 1970s (while his father became chairman of the board), he renamed it to The Trump Organization. In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments, rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. An agreement was later signed in which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League. Trump's first major real estate deal in Manhattan was the remodeling of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The building was remodeled from an older Commodore Hotel, and was largely funded by a $70 million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. In 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, for which The New York Times attributed his ""persistence"" and ""skills as a negotiator"". The building was completed in 1983, and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization. Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice, and includes a fully functional television studio set. Repairs on the Wollman Rink in Central Park, built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a general contractor unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected  2 1⁄2-year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $750,000 less than the initial budget of $1.95 million, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concession rights. Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 for $400 million, and tapped his then-wife Ivana to manage its operation and renovation. Trump acquired the historical Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1985 for $5 million, plus $3 million for the home's furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with Lee Iacocca that became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches. Harrah's at Trump Plaza opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp. and operated by the Harrah's gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino's poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp. Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump's wife, Ivana, managed the property. Later in 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International. The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built. Financed with $675 million in junk bonds at a 14% interest rate, the project entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year. Banks and bondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted to restructure the debt. The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50 percent ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt. He also sold his financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess. The property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated into Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8 billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50 million in assets and $500 million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties. Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005. During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition of the Native-American owned Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. In 1993, Trump made controversial comments in his testimony to a Congressional committee, famously stating that the casino owners did not look like real Indians. But despite that well-publicized quote which related to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor who backed the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were seeking state recognition. Trump acquired an old, vacant office building on Wall Street in Manhattan in 1996. After a complete renovation, it became the seventy-story Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions of his father's estate valued at $250–300 million. In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters. Trump also began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He continued to own commercial space in Trump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle which he acquired in 1996, and also continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate. Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue. Most recently, The Trump Organization has expanded its footprint beyond the United States, with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, New York City, Washington D.C., Panama City, Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Vancouver. Trump has licensed his name and image for the development of a number of real estate projects including two in Florida that have gone into foreclosure. The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trump also licensed his name to son-in-law Jared Kushner's fifty-story Trump Bay Street, a Jersey City luxury development that has raised $50 million of its $200 million capitalization largely from wealthy Chinese nationals who, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government's expedited EB-5 visa program, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years. Trump is a partner with Kushner Properties only in name licensing and not in the building's financing. The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according to Golfweek. Trump's personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382 million. In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of some local residents on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A 2011 independent documentary, You've Been Trumped, by British filmmaker Anthony S. Baxter, chronicled the golf resort's construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Trump. Despite Trump's promises of 6,000 jobs, in 2016, by his own admission, the golf course has created only 200 jobs. In June 2015, Trump made an appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course, which was dismissed by five justices at the UK Supreme Court in December 2015. In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship 4 times between 1977 and 2009. After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened on June 24, 2016. Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds. Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, ""I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me"" as a tool for trimming debt. The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009). Trump said, ""I've used the laws of this country to pare debt ... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on The Apprentice. It's not personal. It's just business."" An analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist in 2016, concludes that his ""... performance  has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York"", noting both his successes and bankruptcies. A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that ""Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success."" In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, an American Football team playing in the United States Football League (USFL), from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the National Football League (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly. After the 1985 season, the Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers, but had continuing financial troubles. The USFL, which was down to just seven active franchises from a high of 18, was soon forced to fold, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries. He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including Mike Tyson's 1988 fight against Michael Spinks, and at one time, acted as a financial advisor to Tyson. In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia. The inaugural race was controversial, and Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990, because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont. Trump submitted a stalking-horse bid on the Buffalo Bills when it came up for sale following Ralph Wilson's death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, and Kim and Terrence Pegula won the auction. During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL's updated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made ""soft"" and ""weak"", saying a concussion is just ""a ding on the head."" He accused referees of throwing penalty flags needlessly just to be seen on television ""so their wives see them at home."" From 1996 until 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. The Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the California clothing company Pacific Mills. Trump was dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled his pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002. In 2006, Miss USA winner Tara Conner tested positive for cocaine, but Trump let her keep the crown, for the sake of giving her a second chance. That decision by Trump was criticized by Rosie O'Donnell, which led to a feud in which Trump and O'Donnell exchanged public criticisms. In 2012, Trump won a $5 million arbitration award against a contestant who said the show was rigged. In 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump's controversial 2015 presidential campaign remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants. Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation. On September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC's stake and that he had ""settled"" his lawsuits against the network, though it was unclear whether Trump had yet filed lawsuits against NBC. He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards to WME/IMG. The $500 million lawsuit against Univision was settled in February 2016, but terms of the settlement were not disclosed. In 1999, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought nearly 250 foreign fashion models into the United States to work in the fashion industry since 2000. In 2014, the company, along with its president Corrine Nicolas and other managers, were sued by one of the agency's former models, Alexia Palmer, alleging racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud, and violating immigrant wage laws. Palmer alleged that Trump Model Management promised to withhold only 20% of her net pay as agency expenses, but after charging her for ""obscure expenses"", ended up taking 80%. The case was dismissed from U.S. federal court in March 2016, in part because Palmer's immigration status, via H1-B visa sponsored by Trump, required labor complaints to be filed through a separate process. Trump University LLC was an American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, and offered courses, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course. In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word ""university"" violated state law, and after a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the ""Trump Entrepreneurial Institute"". Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation. In 2013 the state of New York filed a $40 million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers. In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias because of his Mexican heritage. On June 7, 2016, Trump clarified that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case. The Low v. Trump case was set for trial in San Diego beginning November 28, 2016. Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases. In the settlement, Trump did not admit to any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a total of $25 million. The settlement was agreed to just an hour before a hearing regarding Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the inauguration. Jason Forge, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said he ""definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach"" from the Trump representatives after the election. Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects as well as commercial products and services, achieving mixed success doing so for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects. In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion. Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects. For that reason, Trump does not own some buildings that display his name. According to Forbes, this portion of Trump's empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562 million valuation, with 33 licensing projects under development including seven Trump International Hotel and Tower ""condo hotels"". Pursuant to the FEC regulations, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form listing all his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions. According to a July 2015 campaign press release, Trump's income for the year 2014 was $362 million. However, Trump has repeatedly declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns, citing a pending IRS audit, despite such an audit not prohibiting him from releasing his current or past tax returns. In doing so, Trump broke nearly 45 years of precedent of candidates for the general election releasing their tax returns to the American public. In October 2016, it was revealed that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax returns. As net operating losses from one year can be applied to offset income from future years, this loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income during the eighteen-year carry forward period. Trump acknowledged using the deduction but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied. When questioned during a presidential debate about such practices, he stated that avoiding paying income tax through such methods ""makes me smart"". The New York Times found that some accountants considered Trump's tax deduction methods in the early 1990s ""legally dubious."" Independent tax experts stated that ""Whatever loophole existed was not 'exploited' here, but stretched beyond any recognition"" and that it involved ""sleight of hand"", further speculating that Trump's casino bankruptcies were probably related to Trump's 1995 reported loss. Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having an estimated $200 million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200 million net worth. He was absent from the list from 1990 to 1995 following losses which reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993. Trump told campaign audiences he began his career with ""a small loan of one million dollars"" from his father, which he paid back with interest. On June 16, 2015, when announcing his candidacy, Trump released a one-page financial summary stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. ""I'm really rich"", he said. Forbes believed his suggestion of $9 billion was ""a whopper"", figuring it was actually $4.1 billion. The summary statement includes $3.3 billion worth of ""real estate licensing deals, brand and branded developments"", putting a figure on Trump's estimate of his own brand value. The July 2015 FEC disclosure reports assets worth above $1.4 billion and debts above $265 million. According to Bloomberg, Trump ""only reported revenue for  golf properties in his campaign filings even though the disclosure form asks for income"", whereas independent filings showed his European golf properties to be unprofitable. After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania, which Forbes estimated negatively impacted his net worth by $125 million. The value of the Trump brand may have fallen further during his presidential campaign, as some consumers boycotted Trump-branded products and services to protest his candidacy. Bookings and foot traffic at Trump-branded properties fell off sharply in 2016, and the release of the Access Hollywood tape recordings in October 2016 exacerbated this. After winning the election, however, his subjective brand value rebounded sharply. In their 2016 annual billionaires' rankings, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $4.5 billion (113th in the United States, 324th in the world) and Bloomberg at $3 billion, making him one of the richest politicians in American history. Trump himself stated that his net worth was over $10 billion, with the discrepancy essentially stemming from the uncertain value of appraised property and of his personal brand. Trump has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award and has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series. He has also played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals. Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000. He has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped! In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively ""fired"" and eliminated from the game. In 2004, Trump filed a trademark application for the catchphrase ""You're fired."" For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode. In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show, although the network did not verify the statement. In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice. In October 2016, the star was targeted by vandals. Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and ""firing"" losers. International versions of The Apprentice franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump. On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season. On February 27, Trump stated that he was ""not ready"" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run. Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production. On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, ""Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump."" After Trump's election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season. Trump is still credited as an executive producer. Trump is a WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) fan, and a friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon. He has hosted two WrestleMania events in the Trump Plaza and has been an active participant in several of the shows. Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was host to the 1991 WBF Championship (which was owned by WWE, known at the time as the ""World Wrestling Federation""). He also appeared in WrestleMania VII. He was interviewed by Jesse Ventura ringside at WrestleMania XX. Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called ""The Battle of the Billionaires."" He was in the corner of Bobby Lashley, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee. The deal was that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost. Lashley won the match, and so McMahon got the haircut. On June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on Monday Night Raw that he had ""sold"" the show to Trump. Appearing on screen, Trump declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show. McMahon ""bought back"" Raw the following week for twice the price. Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the next night. Trump considered the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races. In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000. A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support. Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still won the party's California and Michigan primaries after doing so. In February 2009, Trump appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that ""instead of asking for money"", General Motors ""should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal"". As Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States. A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run. His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice. Trump played a leading role in longstanding ""birther"" conspiracy theories. Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Barack Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as President. Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008, Trump demanded to see the original ""long-form"" certificate. He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings. He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya. When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate, Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying ""I hope it checks out."" His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand, and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted. In 2013 he said, ""I don't think I went overboard. Actually, I think it made me very popular."" When asked in 2015 whether Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss it further. Earlier, Trump had also called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school. In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and claimed that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. In February 2011, Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. Christopher R. Barron, co-founder of GOProud who would later not only endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but also launch LGBT for Trump, said he ""would love to see Mr. Trump run for president."" The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party. In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates. On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have won. In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump said that President Obama gets ""unprecedented media protection"", spoke against illegal immigration, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Also in 2013, he spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States. In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014, against Andrew Cuomo; Trump said in response that while New York had problems and taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him. A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election. He also made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community. In February 2015, Trump said he told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice at that time, as he mulled his political future. Trump's party affiliation has changed over the years. Although his party affiliation prior to 1987 is unclear, Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for United States President in the late 1970s. By 1987, he identified as a Republican. In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani within the party. From 2001 to 2008 he was a Democrat, but in 2008 he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican. In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he has pledged to stay. Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans. After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats. In February 2012, Trump endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President. When asked in 2015 which recent President he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes. According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name. Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to curry favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends. On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in New York City. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large themes during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness, stated that the media has intentionally misinterpreted his words, and made other claims of adverse media bias. In part due to his fame, Trump's run for president received an unprecedented amount of unpaid coverage from the media that elevated his standing in the Republican primaries. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him early on. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared he could harm the image of the Republican Party. The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration. Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists. In August he appointed as his campaign CEO Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, described by Bannon as ""the platform for the alt-right"". Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on protesters inside the rallies, and clashes between protesters and Trump supporters outside the venues. Fact checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates. At least four major publications – Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times – pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements. Trump's penchant for exaggerating may have roots in the world of New York real estate where he made his fortune, and where hyperbole is a way of life; Trump calls it ""truthful hyperbole"". Lucas Graves, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Journalism & Mass Communication, says that Trump often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers ""have to be really careful when you pick claims to check to pick things ... that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate"". Other sources, such as NPR, also observed that Trump's statements during the campaign were often opaque or suggestive. Trump entered a large field of candidates against 16 other Republicans campaigning for the nomination, the largest presidential field in American history. Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the seventh debate on January 28 (that was the last debate before primary voting began on February 1). The debates received historically high viewership, increasing the visibility of Trump's campaign. By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote and remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination. After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee. With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party. He also set the record for the largest number of votes against the front runner. After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to ""save  vote for the general election."" Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old British man illegally residing in the U.S. during one of his rallies in Las Vegas. Clinton had established a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy. FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified government material. One study argues that it was in fact Trump's grandiosity that attracted voters. A test was carried out by blind raters in which Trump scored highest on grandiosity ratings, use of first person pronouns, greater pitch dynamics and informal communication. After Trump won the Republican presidential nomination, historians Fredrik Logevall and Kenneth Osgood noted that, ""Hardly a day passes without some columnist comparing Donald J. Trump to Huey Long, Father Coughlin or George Wallace."" On July 15, 2016, Trump announced Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate. Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention. The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole but the other prior nominees did not attend, though John McCain endorsed Trump prior to the convention. Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech. The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35 million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls. In late July, Trump came close to Clinton in national polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the small side by historical standards. Following Clinton's 7 percent convention bounce, she extended her lead significantly in national polls at the start of August. Trump has declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns, which led to speculation about whether he was hiding something. Trump said that his tax returns are being audited and his lawyers advise against release. High-income individuals are audited more frequently than the average taxpayer, but it is unusual for an individual to be audited for several consecutive years. Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was ""none of your business"", but added, ""I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible"". Every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 released their taxes before the election. Although no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit, tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy. On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Lester Holt, an anchor with NBC News, was the moderator. This was the most watched presidential debate in United States history. The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments (see below), and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on October 19. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election drew particular press attention. Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced, made on a studio bus while preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. On the tape, Trump is heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women with the show's then-cohost Billy Bush. ""I just start kissing them"", he says, ""I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab them by the pussy."" He also speaks of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he ""moved on her very heavily."" These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third wife, Melania, who was also pregnant at the time. Trump's language was described by the media as ""vulgar"", ""sexist"", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign, and caused outrage across the political spectrum, with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race. Subsequently, at least 15 women came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage. Trump and his campaign have denied all of these accusations. He has called them ""false smears"" and alleged a conspiracy against him. In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had ""abused women"" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims. Trump's statement was criticized severely by the media and members of the public as insincere, and an attempt to divert attention away from Trump's comments and onto unsubstantiated accusations against his political opponents. On December 9, 2016, senior Obama administration officials indicated that Russia provided Wikileaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta with the goal of influencing the outcome of the election. The FBI later affirmed this assessment. Trump's transition team dismissed the allegations with a statement which said: ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."" Wikileaks denied any involvement of Russian authorities. On December 15, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that Trump knew that Russia was interfering in order to help him, as the presidential campaign was ongoing. On January 3, 2017, Fox News reported that Trump was planning to restructure the intelligence community. On January 8, 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported that the U.S. intelligence report does not say whether the Russian hacking helped elect Trump. The report concludes that while Russian president Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump, it does not conclude that Russia's hacking made a difference in the election. On November 8, 2016, Trump won the presidency with 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232 votes. Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, and he is the fifth person to become president without winning the popular vote. The final popular vote difference between Clinton and Trump is that Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 45.95%, with neither candidate reaching a majority. The last time the Electoral College winner lost the nationwide popular vote by over two percentage points was the election of 1876. Trump will be the first president without prior governmental or military experience. Of the 44 previous presidents, 39 had held prior elective office; 2 had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and 3 had never held public office but had been commanding generals. Trump lost his home state of New York, becoming only the fourth candidate to win the presidency without his home state. The others were James Polk (Tennessee) in 1844, Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey) in 1916, and Richard Nixon (New York) in 1968. Trump's victory was considered a big political upset, as nearly all national polls at the time showed Hillary Clinton with a modest lead over Trump, and state polls showed her with a modest lead to win the Electoral College. The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters. Trump's victory marked the first time that Republicans would control the White House and both chambers of Congress since the period from 2003 to 2007. In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Trump received a phone call in which Clinton conceded the presidency to him. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the Hilton Hotel in New York City. The speech was in stark contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans. Trump's victory sparked protests across the United States. Democrats, in alignment with other Trump opponents, took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump's views and denounce his inflammatory statements. They argued that Clinton's popular vote victory meant Trump was not actually the democratically-elected president and should be considered illegitimate. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of ""professional protesters, incited by the media"", and were ""unfair"", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country. In contrast, after Obama's re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted ""We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!"" On November 10, President-elect Trump had his first meeting with President Obama to discuss plans for a peaceful transition of power. The New York Times stated that ""It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites."" The BBC stated that ""their antipathy was barely concealed"" in ""awkward photos"" of the meeting. Trump's transition team was led by Chris Christie until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over. Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as Counselor to the President. He has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Representative Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services, former campaign rival Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce, Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, Marine Corps General John F. Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security, businessman Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor, CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy, and U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior. On November 22, in a video posted at YouTube, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office. The plan included the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the United States from cyber-attack. On December 7, Time named Trump as its ""Person of the Year"". In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the ""President of the Divided States of America"". On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year. In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel. Media have described Trump's political positions as ""populist"", and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation, consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment, usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy. According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a ""fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views"", but he has a revolutionary ability to attract free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments. Trump has supported varying political leanings and positions over time. Politico has described his positions as ""eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory"", while NBC News counted ""141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues"" during his campaign. He has listed several different party affiliations over the years and has also run as a Reform Party candidate. Trump's campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions, and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large ""zero bracket"" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated. His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent. Many economists have been critical of Trump's economic policies, with several reports assessing that his campaign plan would increase tax rates for families earning between $20,000 to $200,000 a year, cause long-term job losses and recession, and significantly increase the federal debt. Trump identifies as a ""free trader"", but says that trade must be ""reasonably fair"". He has often been called a ""protectionist"", because of his criticism of NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and his proposal to raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States significantly. He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted. Trump's energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter. His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action. Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2012 he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking. He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a ""disgrace"" and has threatened to cut its budget. Bob Walker, a senior campaign adviser, has announced plans to eliminate funding for the NASA Earth Science program. Trump has pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries. However, after winning the presidency, Trump admitted ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate variability and said he has an ""open mind"" towards the Paris agreement. On December 5, 2016, Donald and Ivanka Trump invited prominent climate change activist Al Gore to a private meeting. Trump has been described as non-interventionist and nationalist. Trump has repeatedly stated that he supports ""America First"" foreign policy, though he is not linked to the historical isolationist America First Party (1944) or the defunct paleoconservative America First Party (2002). He supports increasing United States military defense spending, but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region. He says America should look inward, stop ""nation building"", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs. He questions whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members, and suggests that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance. Trump has called for Japan to pay for the costs of American troops stationed there and that it might need to develop nuclear weapons in order to protect itself from North Korea. In order to confront ISIS, Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops. In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region, a position he retracted. Also in 2016, when asked how he would handle ISIS using human shields, Trump responded with ""you have to take out their families"". He has since argued that regional allies of the U.S., such as Saudi Arabia should provide troops in the fight. He also believes that oil fields in ISIS-controlled areas should be bombed. He supports the use of waterboarding, a form of torture, and has said he would ""bring back a hell of a lot worse"". Trump has also said he will dismantle the international nuclear agreement with Iran as president. Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is ""a big fan of Israel."" He supports Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. During his 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said that he opposed the Iraq War even before it was launched, although his public position had been unclear at the time. In 2002, when asked whether he supported invading Iraq, Trump responded, ""Yeah, I guess so"" and added ""I wish the first time it was done correctly"" in reference to the Gulf War of 1990–1991. Shortly before the 2003 invasion, he said: ""Well,  either got to do something—or not do something, perhaps.  And perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations."" Trump publicly referred to the war as a ""mess"" within a week after it began, and by 2004 he said he was opposed to it. Since 2004, he has repeatedly criticized the war, especially during the primary debates with Jeb Bush. Trump has at times during his presidential campaign stated that the Afghanistan War was a mistake, and at other times stated that it was necessary. He supports keeping a limited number of United States troops there. Trump was a supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya at the time, stating in February 2011 ""We should go in, we should stop , which would be very easy and very quick, we could do it surgically."" He has since then reversed his position, stating in February 2016 that ""We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now."" Trump would consider recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia. He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants. Trump's immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Some of his proposals came under scrutiny by several experts on immigration who question the effectiveness and affordability of his plans. Trump vows to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promises Mexico will pay for. He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States, and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates ""anchor babies"". Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States until proper filtering could be implemented. He changed his position in 2016 by stating that the temporary ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a ""proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies"", or countries ""compromised by terrorism"". Trump characterized this as an expansion, not rollback, of his original proposal. In August 2016, Trump hinted he might soften his position calling for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants. On August 31, 2016, he visited Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, saying he wanted to build relations with the country. However, in a major speech later that night, Trump laid out a 10-point plan reaffirming his hardline positions, including building a wall along the Mexican border to be paid for by Mexico, potentially deporting ""anyone who has entered the United States illegally"", denying legal status to such people unless they leave the country and apply for re-entry, and creating a deportation task force. He said the focus of the task force would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other ""security threats"". Trump describes himself as pro-life and generally opposes abortion with some exceptions: rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother, and said he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade. He personally supports ""traditional marriage"" but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a ""settled"" issue. Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time. Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana. He favors capital punishment, as well as the use of waterboarding, which is a form of torture. Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""). His 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model. Although remarks from Trump as recently as January 2015 seem to hold up foreign single-payer healthcare systems as models to emulate. and his September 2015 remarks indicate support for government-funded universal healthcare, during the 2016 campaign Trump distanced himself from a single-payer system without providing clarity about his present proposals. In March 2016, Trump's campaign released a platform summary which included a variety of free-market reforms including provisions to allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states. Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities. Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools. He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools, and has called Common Core ""a disaster"" that must be ended. He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education. Trump has five children by three marriages, and has eight grandchildren. His first two marriages ended in divorces that were publicized in the tabloid media. Trump married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by one of America's most famous ministers, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale. They had three children: son Donald Jr. (born December 31, 1977), daughter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981), and son Eric (born January 6, 1984). Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric now serve as executive vice presidents of The Trump Organization. Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988. Trump has been nicknamed ""The Donald"" since Ivana referred to him as such in a 1989 Spy magazine cover story. By early 1990, Trump's troubled marriage to Ivana and affair with actress Marla Maples had been reported in the tabloid press. Ivana Trump was granted an uncontested divorce in 1990, on the grounds that Trump's treatment of her, such as his affair with Maples, had been ""cruel and inhuman"". In 1992, he successfully sued Ivana for violating a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him in her book. In 2015, Ivana said that she and Donald ""are the best of friends"". Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany, named after Tiffany & Company (Trump's purchase of the air rights above the store in the 1980s allowed him to build Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue), on October 13, 1993. They married two months later on December 20, 1993. The couple formally separated in May 1997, with their divorce finalized in June 1999. Tiffany was raised by her mother in Calabasas, California, where she lived until her graduation from Viewpoint School. In 1998, Trump began a relationship with Slovene model Melania Knauss, who became his third wife. They were engaged in April 2004 and were married on January 22, 2005, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In 2006, Melania became a naturalized United States citizen. On March 20, 2006, she gave birth to their son, whom they named Barron Trump. Having heard the language since his birth, Barron is fluent in Slovene. In a February 2009 interview on ABC's news program Nightline, Trump commented that his love for his business had made it difficult for his first two wives to compete with his affection for work. Trump's brother, Fred Jr., predeceased their father Fred. Shortly after the latter died in 1999, the wife of Fred Jr.'s son gave birth to a son with serious medical problems. Trump and his family offered to pay the medical bills through Fred Sr.'s company (Fred Sr. freely provided medical coverage to his family through his company for decades). Fred III then sued the family for allegedly having used ""undue influence"" on a dementia-stricken Fred Sr. to get Fred III and his sister Mary a reduced share from their grandfather's will, but Trump attributed the reduced share to his father's dislike of Fred III's mother, and Trump stopped the aid for Fred III's son. The aid was resumed by court order pending outcome of the lawsuit, which was then settled. Trump is a Presbyterian. He has said that he began going to church at the First Presbyterian Church in the Jamaica neighborhood in Queens as a child. Trump attended Sunday school and had his confirmation at that church. In an April 2011 interview on The 700 Club, he commented: ""I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion."" Trump told a 2015 South Carolina campaign audience he attends Marble Collegiate Church, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977. A representative from the church said that, though Trump has a longstanding history with the church, being a Presbyterian he was not an active member of Marble. Trump is also loosely affiliated with Lakeside Presbyterian Church in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is nearby his Palm Beach estate. Trump has said that although he participates in Holy Communion, he has not asked God for forgiveness for his sins. He stated, ""I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture."" Trump calls his own book The Art of the Deal (1987) ""my second favorite book of all time"", and has told campaign audiences: ""Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible."" Declining to name his favorite Bible verse, Trump said ""I don't like giving that out to people that you hardly know."" His religious knowledge was questioned after a speech he gave to Liberty University, in which he referred to Second Corinthians as ""Two Corinthians"", eliciting chuckles from some in the audience. Trump maintains relationships with several prominent national Evangelical Protestant and other Christian leaders, including Tony Perkins and Ralph E. Reed Jr. At an Algemeiner Journal awards ceremony honoring him with the Algemeiner Liberty Award, he was asked about having Jewish grandchildren. In reference to daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: ""Not only do I have Jewish grandchildren, I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that ... it wasn't in the plan but I am very glad it happened."" Controversy involving the Pope In February 2016, while on his way home following a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis said the following when asked about Trump: Trump responded that it was ""disgraceful"" for the Pope to question his faith, suggesting that the Mexican government was ""using the Pope as a pawn"" for political purposes, ""because they want to continue to rip off the United States."" Trump added that ""if and when"" Islamic State attacks the Vatican, the Pope would have ""wished and prayed"" Trump were President because under his leadership such an attack would not happen. The following day, Director of the Holy See Press Office Federico Lombardi insisted that the Pope was not launching an attack on Trump nor trying to sway voters by declaring that someone who advocates building walls is not Christian. After the clarification by Lombardi, Trump downplayed his differences with the Pope, saying ""I don't think this is a fight."" A medical report by his doctor, Harold Bornstein M.D., showed that Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid function were in normal range. Trump says that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed other drugs, including marijuana. He also does not drink alcohol, a decision stemming from his brother's death caused by alcoholism. His BMI, according to his December 2016 visit on Doctor Oz, is just under 30, which is ""high"". The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal by Trump and Tony Schwartz. The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump, who has not given personally to the charity since 2008. In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York. A Trump spokesman called the investigation a ""partisan hit job"". The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups. In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000). From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007. After winning the presidency, Trump announced his intention to give Linda McMahon a cabinet-level position in his administration, as Administrator of the Small Business Administration. An analysis by USA Today, published in June 2016, found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses had been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state courts, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate. Of the 3,500 suits, mostly in the casino industry, Trump or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900; defendant in 1,450; and third party, filer of bankruptcy, or other in 150. Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court. Although litigation over contract disputes and other matters is common in the real estate industry, USA Today found that Trump had been involved in more legal disputes than Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., Donald Bren, Stephen M. Ross, Sam Zell, and Larry Silverstein combined. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. Hundreds of cases have ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution, but where there was a clear resolution, he has won 451 times and lost 38. 1980s In 1985, Trump was sued by both the State of New York and the City of New York for allegedly trying to force out tenants to enable demolition. The matter was settled and the demolition canceled. In 1988, Trump paid $750,000 to settle the civil penalties in an antitrust lawsuit stemming from stock purchases. 1990s In 1991, a business analyst predicted that the Trump Taj Mahal would soon fail, and he then lost his job; the analyst sued Trump for allegedly having an unlawful role in the firing, and that matter was settled confidentially out of court. After a helicopter crashed, killing three executives of his New Jersey hotel casino business, Trump sued the manufacturers, and that case was dismissed. Trump Plaza was fined $200,000 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for moving African-American and female employees away from a racist and sexist gambler to accommodate him, but Trump was not evidently investigated, nor held personally liable, and said he would not even recognize that gambler. In 1991, Trump's father, Fred Trump, made an unlawful loan to Trump's Castle to help it make a mortgage payment, and the casino was required to pay a $30,000 fine, but his son was not penalized. In 1993, Trump sued his business partner Jay Pritzker for allegedly collecting excessive fees, and the matter was settled. Boarding house owner Vera Coking sued for damage during construction of an adjacent casino, and later dropped the suit against Trump while settling with his contractor; she also prevailed against Trump and other developers in an eminent domain case. In 1997, Trump and rival Atlantic City casino owner Stephen Wynn engaged in an extended legal conflict during the planning phase of new casinos Wynn had proposed to build, and the cases were settled. 2000s In 2000, Trump was charged with lobbying for government rejection of proposed casinos that would compete with his casinos, and he paid $250,000 to settle resulting fines. The charges related to a proposed Native American-run casino in the Catskills, New York, which would have competed with three of Trump's casinos in Atlantic City. When the Securities and Exchange Commission charged one of his companies with poor financial reporting, Trump's attorney said the culprit had been dismissed, and that Trump had personally been unaware of the matter. Following litigation with Leona Helmsley that started in the 1990s regarding control of the Empire State Building, Trump in 2002 sold his share in that building to rivals of Helmsley's. In 2004 Trump sued former business partner Richard Fields for allegedly saying he still consulted for Trump. Fields counter-sued, and the lawsuit was dismissed. The town of Palm Beach, Florida fined Trump for building an 80-foot (24-meter) pole for the American flag at his Mar-a-Lago property. Trump then sued, and a settlement required him to donate $100,000 to veterans' charities, while the town agreed to let him enroll out-of-towners in his social club and permitted a 10-foot shorter flagpole elsewhere on his lawn. When the California city of Rancho Palos Verdes thwarted luxury home development on a landslide-prone area owned by Trump, he sued, and the city agreed to permit extensions for 20 more proposed luxury homes. Trump sued a law firm he had used, Morrison Cohen, for using his name, for providing news links at its website, and for charging excessive fees, after which the firm halved the fees, and the court ruled that the links were allowable. In 2009, Trump was sued by investors in the canceled Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico; Trump said he had merely been a spokesperson, and he settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. In 2004, the Trump Organization licensed the Trump brand to a hotel and condo project in Fort Lauderdale scheduled to open in 2007, but delays in construction and the bursting of the U.S. real estate bubble led Trump to withdraw his name from the deal in 2009, after which the project defaulted, investors sued, and Trump was caught in the ongoing lawsuits because he had participated in advertising. Trump personally guaranteed $40 million to secure a $640 million loan for Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. When Deutsche Bank tried to collect it, Trump sued the bank for harming the project and his reputation, and the bank then agreed to extend the loan term by five years. 2010s In 2015, Trump's claim that the Scottish Government improperly approved a wind-farm project near his golf course and planned hotel was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, following a lengthy legal battle. In July 2015, Trump sued the former Miss Pennsylvania, Sheena Monnin, after she alleged that the Miss USA 2012 pageant was rigged. A federal judge upheld the settlement, obliging her to pay Trump $5 million. Trump sued Palm Beach County, alleging that the county had pressured the FAA to direct air traffic over Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and estate. He also sued chefs Geoffrey Zakarian and José Andrés; the latter said there was no merit in Trump's allegation that the chef backed out of a deal at the Old Post Office Pavilion. Trump sued the town of Ossining, New York, over the property tax valuation on his golf course there, after separately being sued for modifying a drainage system that allegedly damaged a library, public pool, and park facilities.  "
5,Le Pen,"Marion Anne Perrine Le Pen, known as Marine Le Pen (French pronunciation: ​; born 5 August 1968) is a French politician who is the president of the National Front (FN), a national-conservative political party in France and one of its main political forces. An attorney by profession, she is the youngest daughter of longtime FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. She is the aunt of Marion Maréchal-Le Pen. Le Pen joined the National Front in 1986 and has been elected as a regional councillor (1998–present), a Member of European Parliament (2004–present), and a municipal councillor in Hénin-Beaumont (2008-2011). She was a candidate for the leadership of the FN in 2011 and won with 67.65% (11,546 votes) of the vote, defeating her opponent Bruno Gollnisch and succeeding her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the party for nearly forty years. She then became the second president of the party. In 2012, she placed third in the presidential election with 17.90% of the vote, behind François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father, Le Pen has led a movement of ""de-demonization of the Front National"" to detoxify it and soften its image, based on renovated positions and renewed teams, also expelling controversial members accused of racism, antisemitism, or pétainism. An important moment was when she said that the Holocaust was the ""height of barbarism"". She finally expelled her father from the party on 20 August 2015 after new controversial statements. She has also relaxed some political positions of the party, advocating for civil unions for same-sex couples instead of her party's previous opposition to legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. Le Pen was ranked among the most influential people in 2011 and 2015 by the Time 100. In 2016, she was ranked as second-most influential MEP in the European Parliament by Politico, just behind the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.   Marion Anne Perrine Le Pen was born on 5 August 1968 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. She is the youngest of the three daughters of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Breton politician and a former paratrooper, with his first wife Pierrette Lalanne. She was baptized 25 April 1969, at La Madeleine by Father Pohpot. Her godfather was Henri Botey, a relative of her father. She has two sisters: Yann and Marie Caroline. In 1976, Marine survived a bomb attack on the family as they slept in their beds. She was eight when a bomb meant for her father exploded in the stairwell outside the family's apartment. The blast ripped a hole into the outside wall of the building. Marine, her two older sisters and their parents were unharmed. She was a student at the lycée Florent Schmitt at Saint-Cloud. Her parents divorced in 1987. Le Pen studied law at Panthéon-Assas University, graduating with a Master of Laws in 1991 and a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in criminal law in 1992. Registered at the Paris bar association, she worked as a lawyer for six years (1992–1998). Part of her legal work involved representing illegal immigrants. In France, when a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, one is chosen to represent him or her. She often fulfilled this role. In 1992, she received the certificate as a lawyer (CAPA) and became a lawyer practising in Paris. She then argued regularly before the criminal chamber of the 23rd District Court of Paris which judges immediate appearances. She reported that she was brought in this context, to defend illegal immigrants. She was a member of the Bar of Paris until 1998, when she joined the legal department of the National Front. Le Pen was married in 1995 to Franck Chauffroy, a business executive who worked for the National Front. By Chauffroy, she has three children (Jehanne, Louis, and Mathilde). After her divorce from Chauffroy in 2000, she married Eric Lorio in 2002, the former national secretary of the National Front and a former adviser to the Regional election in Nord-Pas de Calais, whom she also divorced in 2006. Since 2009, she has been in a relationship with Louis Aliot, whose grandfather was Algerian Jewish. Aliot was the National Front General Secretary from 2005 to 2010, then the National Front vice president who was in charge of the Project. She spends most of her time in Saint-Cloud, and has resided in La Celle-Saint-Cloud with her three children since September 2014. She has an apartment in Hénin-Beaumont. In 2010, she also bought a house with Aliot in Millas. In 1986, at the age of 18, Marine Le Pen joined the FN. In 2000, she became president of Generations Le Pen, a loose association close to the party aimed at ""de-demonizing the Front National"". In 1998, she joined the FN's juridical branch, which she led until 2003. In 2000, she joined the FN Executive Committee (bureau politique). In 2003, she became vice-president of the FN. In 2006, Jean-Marie Le Pen entrusted her with the management of his 2007 presidential campaign. In 2007, she became one of the two executive vice-presidents of the FN and was in charge of training, communication and publicity. In 1998, she acquired her first political mandate when she was elected regional councillor in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. From 2002, she began to establish her parliamentary base in the former coal mining area of the Pas-de-Calais. Her aim is to expand the political influence of the FN and transform it into a ""big popular party that addresses itself not only to the electorate on the right but to all the French people"". She has frequently stated that she rules out any political alliance with the Union for a Popular Movement. She has at numerous times distanced herself from some of Jean-Marie Le Pen's controversial statements, notably those relating to war-crimes, which the media point to her attempts to improve the party's image. While her father has provoked a long-time controversy by saying that the gas chambers were ""a detail of the history of World War II"", she said it has been ""the height of barbarism"". Her candidacy was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of senior executives and notably by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the FN. She spent four months campaigning for the FN leadership, holding meetings with FN members in 51 departments to explain in detail her political views and projects for the party. All the other departments were visited by one of her official supporters. On 3 September 2010, she launched her internal campaign at Cuers, Var. During a meeting in Paris on 14 November 2010, she claimed: ""My project is not to assemble our political family, or rather is not only to assemble our political family. It consists of shaping the Front National as the center of grouping of the whole French people"". She also explained why the FN leadership and the candidature for the presidential election must not be dissociated: thus the next FN leader will run in the 2012 presidential election. During her final meeting at Hénin-Beaumont on 19 December 2010, she claimed that the FN presents the real debates of the next presidential campaign. Most of her campaign tours throughout France were reported in local newspapers and regional television programmes. In December 2010 and early January 2011, FN members voted by post to elect their new president and the hundred members of the Central Committee. The party held its congress at Tours for two days (15–16 January 2011). On 16 January 2011, Marine Le Pen was officially elected with 67.65% (11,546 votes) as the new president of the Front National and Jean-Marie Le Pen became de facto its honorary chairman. Her challenger Bruno Gollnisch polled 32.35% (5,522 votes). Marine Le Pen stirred up controversy during the internal campaign. During a speech to the party faithful in Lyon on 10 December 2010, she said that the weekly illegal blocking of public streets and squares in multiple French cities (notably the rue Myrha in the 18th arrondissement of Paris) for Muslim prayers was comparable with an occupation of parts of French territory. Specifically, Le Pen said: The mention of World War II brought claims from the media and politicians that she had drawn an irresponsible parallel with the Nazi occupation of France (May 1940 – December 1944). Nearly the entire political and media class strongly criticised her statement, which was widely commented on by different political analysts. Whereas the CRIF, the French Council of Muslim Faith (CFCM) and the LICRA denounced her statement, other groups like the MRAP and the LDH declared their intention of lodging a formal complaint. The imam of the Great Mosque of Paris and former president of the CFCM, Dalil Boubakeur, claimed that though her parallel was questionable and condemnable, she had asked a valid question. A member of the FN's Executive Committee, Louis Aliot, denounced ""the attempted manipulation of opinion by communitarian groups and those really responsible for the current situation in France"". On 13 December 2010, she confirmed her statement during a press conference held in the FN's headquarters in Nanterre. After Jean-François Kahn's comments on BFM TV on 13 December 2010, she denounced ""state manipulation"" mounted from the Elysée with the intention of demonizing her in public opinion. On 15 December 2015, the Lyon court acquitted her of ""inciting hatred"", considering that her statement ""did not target all of the Muslim community"" and was protected ""as a part of freedom of expression"". Furthermore, France is a secular state prohibiting public religious demonstrations such as street prayers. Her various appearances on television and radio have played an important role in her political rise at national and local levels. Her political personality regularly attracts the attention of the French media as well as the European, the Middle Eastern and the US press. On 5 May 2002, after the run-off in the 2002 presidential election, she took part in a televised debate on France 3. Political analysts compared her appearance to a ""media baptism"" and claim that her political emergence has its roots in this debate. During the programme Mots croisés (Crossed Words) on France 2 on 5 October 2009, Marine Le Pen quoted sections of Frédéric Mitterrand's autobiographical novel The Bad Life, accusing him of having sex with underage boys and engaging in ""sex tourism"", demanding his resignation as a Minister of Culture. According to French political commentator Jérôme Fourquet, during the Mitterrand case she broke through and gained a media ascendancy over the party. Hosted on France 2 by journalist and commentator Arlette Chabot, À vous de juger (You Be The Judge) was one of France's foremost political programmes. For her first appearance as a guest debater on 14 January 2010, Marine Le Pen opposed Éric Besson, then Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Mutually Supportive Development. For her first appearance as a main guest on 9 December 2010, she was successively questioned on economic, societal and immigration matters by Arlette Chabot and political commentator Alain Duhamel, then debated with the socialist mayor of Évry Manuel Valls and finally was matched against Rachida Dati, former Minister of Justice. Her appearance attracted 3,356,000 viewers (14.6% of the televised audience), which represented the highest viewing figures for 2010 and the fourth best since the start of the series in September 2005. In December 2010, French journalist Guillaume Tabard described her as the ""revelation of the year"". He further described her as ""first an electoral phenomenon"" and ""a media phenomenon after"". Hosted on France 2 by journalist and anchorman David Pujadas, Des paroles et des actes (Words and Acts) replaced À vous de juger. For her first appearance as a main guest on 23 June 2011, Le Pen opposed Cécile Duflot, national secretary of the Greens. Her appearance attracted 3,582,000 viewers which represented 15.1% of the televised audience. Hosted on TF1 by anchorwoman Laurence Ferrari and political commentator François Bachy, Parole directe (Direct Speech) is one of France's foremost political programmes. For her first appearance as a sole guest on 15 September 2011, Le Pen attracted an average of 6 million viewers (23.3% of the televised audience) with a peak of 7.3 million in the second half of the programme. At an international level, she was invited by the Quebec web-radio Rockik in December 2008, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (Radio Canada) in May 2010 and the Israeli radio 90FM in March 2011. In March 2011, she appeared on the front cover page of The Weekly Standard magazine with the heading ""The Future of the European Right?"". During a press conference organized on 13 January 2012 by the European American Press Club, she spoke in front of international journalists about various topical and thematic issues. On 4 April 2011, she appeared for the first time as a candidate in the 2011 Time 100 Poll. On 21 April, she was listed in the 2011 Time 100. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and vice chairman of the State Duma, wrote a commentary about her political destiny. In October 2011, she presented her book in Verona, Italy and met Assunta Almirante, the widow of the far-right MSI leader Giorgio Almirante. The logo of the Front National was inspired by MSI logo. In February 2013, she spoke at the Cambridge Union Society, the University of Cambridge's debating society. Her appearance sparked controversy, with anti-fascist group Unite Against Fascism opposing her invitation on a No Platform basis and organising a demonstration of about 200 people outside the venue. The protests were supported by numerous Cambridge societies, including Cambridge University Students' Union and Cambridge Universities Labour Club, however others, notably the Cambridge Libertarians, supported her right to freedom of expression. From a general point of view, Marine Le Pen is often judged more moderate than her father. A part of the French electorate considers her positions more nuanced, polished and detoxified than Jean-Marie Le Pen's ""provocations"". Her smiling, calm image contrasts with much of the stereotypes generally attributed to her political family. At the beginning of her media rise, she often talked about her particular treatment as the daughter of ""Le Pen"" and of the 1976 attack (then the biggest bomb explosion in France since World War II). It has been seen as a way to humanize her party. For example, Bernard-Henri Lévy, a strong opponent of the FN, talked about ""a far-right with a human face"". Journalist Michèle Cotta claims that the fact she is a young woman condemning racism and refusing her father's ""faults"" (notably his enjoyment of shocking other people) contributed to her strategy of de-demonization of the National Front. References to World War II or to the French colonial wars are absent from her speeches, which is often looked on as a generation gap. She distanced herself from her father on the gas chambers he famously called ""a detail in the history of World War II"", saying that she ""didn’t share the same vision of these events"". L’Express wrote that the exclusion of Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2015 was the completion of her endeavour. The opponents of the FN denounce a more dangerous strategy because of its evident success. In a 2010 RTL interview, Le Pen stated that her strategy was not about changing the FN's program but about showing it as it really is, instead of the image given to it by the media in the previous decades. The media and her political adversaries are accused of spreading an ""unfair, wrong and caricatural"" image of the National Front. She refuses the qualification of far-right or extreme-right, considering it a ""perjorative"" term : ""How am I party of the extreme right? ... I don't think that our propositions are extreme propositions, whatever the subject"". However, the radical far-right (Minute, Rivarol, Patrick Buisson, Henry de Lesquen,..) reproached her for abandoning or softening her stance on immigration, gay marriage and abortion. In her speech in Lyon on 10 December 2010, she mentioned the fate of gays living in sensible neighbourhoods, victims of religious laws replacing the republican law. In 2014, the American magazine Foreign Policy mentioned her, along with four other Frenchmen, in its list of the 100 global thinkers of the year, underlining the way she ""renovated the image"" of her party, which had became a model for other right-wing parties in Europe after her success in the European elections. At a European level, she stopped the alliance built by her father with some right-wing extremist parties and refused to be part of a group with the radical Jobbik or the neo-nazi Golden dawn. Her transnational allies share the fact that they have officially condemned antisemitism, accepted a more liberal approach toward social matters and to be sometimes pro-Israel such as the Dutch PVV. French historian Nicolas Lebourg concluded she is looked upon as a compass for them in order to copy while maintaining local particularities. For a long time, she has been reluctant to endorse Donald Trump, while other European populists have already embraced his candidacy, and only supported him by saying: ""For France, anything is better than Hillary Clinton"". However, on 8 November 2016 she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his presidential victory. Nevertheless, her strategy has difficulties as her image seems to remain controversial: Germany's Angela Merkel has said she will ""I will contribute to make other political forces be stronger than the National Front"" and Israel still holds a bad opinion of her party. Nigel Farage has said : ""I've never said a bad word about Marine Le Pen; I've never said a good word about her party"". Her social program and her support of SYRIZA in the 2015 Greek general elections have led Nicolas Sarkozy to declare her a far-left politician sharing some of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's propositions. President François Hollande said she was talking ""like a leaflet of the Communist Party"". Eric Zemmour, journalist for the conservative newspaper Le Figaro, wrote during the 2012 presidential election that the FN had become a left-wing party under the influence of Florian Philippot. As a president of the Front National, Marine Le Pen currently sits as an ex officio member among the FN Executive Office (8 members), the Executive Committee (42 members) and the Central Committee (3 ex officio members, 100 elected members, 20 co-opted members). During her opening speech in Tours on 16 January 2011, she advocated to ""restore the political framework of the national community"" and to implement the direct democracy which enables the ""civic responsibility and the collective tie"" thanks to the participation of public-spirited citizens for the decisions. The predominant political theme was the uncompromising defence of a protective and efficient State, which favours secularism, prosperity and liberties. She also denounced the ""Europe of Brussels"" which ""everywhere imposed the destructive principles of ultra-liberalism and Free trade, at the expense of public utilities, employment, social equity and even our economic growth which became within twenty years the weakest of the world"". After the traditional Joan of Arc and Labor Day march in Paris on 1 May 2011, she gave her first speech in front of 3000 supporters. On 11 August 2011, she held an exceptional press conference about the current systemic crisis. On 10 and 11 September 2011, she made her political comeback with the title ""the voice of people, the spirit of France"" in the convention center of Acropolis in Nice. During her closing speech on 11 September 2011, she tackled the audience about immigration, insecurity, the economic and social situation, reindustrialization and 'strong state'. During a demonstration held in front of the Senate on 8 December 2011, she expressed during a speech her ""firm and absolute opposition"" to the right of foreigners to vote. She regularly holds thematic press conferences and interventions on varied issues in French, European and international politics. Marine Le Pen stood in the 2012 French presidential election. On 16 May 2011, her presidential candidacy was unanimously validated by the FN Executive Committee. On 10 and 11 September 2011, her political comeback in Nice prefigured the launching of her presidential campaign. During a press conference on 6 October 2011, she officially unveiled the line-up of her presidential campaign team. On 19 November 2011, she presented in Paris the main thematic issues of her presidential project: sovereign people and democracy, Europe, reindustrialization and strong state, family and education, immigration and assimilation versus communitarianism, geopolitics and international politics. During a press conference held on 12 January 2012, she presented in detail the assessment of her presidential project and a plan of debt paydown of France. During a press conference held on 1 February 2012, she presented an outline of her presidential project for the overseas departments and territories of France. Many observers have notice her tendance to enhance economical and social subjects such as globalization and delocalisations, instead of immigration or law and order which have been the paramount platform of the FN in the previous decades. On 11 December 2011, she held her first presidential meeting in Metz. From early January to mid April 2012, she held weekly meetings in the major French cities. On 17 April 2012, between 6,000 and 7,000 people took part in her final meeting organized at the Zenith in Paris. On 13 March 2012, she publicly announced that she had the 500 necessary signatures to take part in the presidential election. On 19 March 2012, the Constitutional Council officially validated her candidature and the one of nine others competitors. On 22 April 2012, she polled 17.90% (6,421,426 votes) in the first round and finished in third position behind François Hollande and incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy. Her national result was higher in percentage and votes than those of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 presidential election (16.86%, 4,804,772 votes in the first round; 17.79%, 5,525,034 votes in the run-off). She was in ahead in Gard (25.51%, 106,646 votes) whereas Sarkozy and Hollande respectively polled 24.86% (103,927 votes) and 24.11% (100,778 votes). She came first in her municipal stronghold of Hénin-Beaumont (35.48%, 4,924 votes) whereas Hollande and Sarkozy respectively polled 26,82% (3,723 votes) and 15,76% (2,187 votes). She globally achieved her highest results east of a line from Le Havre in the north to Perpignan in the south. In contrast, she globally polled less in western France, especially big cities such as Paris, overseas and among the French citizens living abroad (5.95%, 23,995 votes). However, she got significative results in two rural departments in western France such as Orne (20.00%, 34,757 votes) and Sarthe (19.17%, 62,516 votes). She achieved her highest regional result in Picardy (25.03%, 266,041 votes), her highest departmental result in Vaucluse (27.03%, 84,585 votes), her highest overseas result in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (15.81%, 416 votes). In addition to Picardy, she also polled over 20% in ten other regions : Corsica (24.39%, 39,209 votes), Champagne-Ardenne (23.91%, 172,632 votes), Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (23.87%, 650,336 votes), Lorraine (23.66%, 308,392 votes), Languedoc-Roussillon (23.45%, 363,880 votes), Nord-Pas-de-Calais (23.29%, 517,115 votes), Alsace (22.12%, 219,252 votes), Franche-Comté (21.29%, 141,972 votes), Burgundy (20.36%, 191,148 votes), Upper Normandy (20.15%, 207,520 votes). In addition to Vaucluse, she also polled over 25% in nine other departments : Aisne (26.33%, 78,452 votes), Meuse (25.82%, 29,038 votes), Corse-du-Sud (25.71%, 19,081 votes), Pas-de-Calais (25.53%, 216,753 votes), Gard (25.51%, 106,646 votes), Haute-Marne (25.26%, 27,624 votes), Aube (25.12%, 40,740 votes), Haute-Saône (25.12%, 36,807 votes), Oise (25.08%, 109,339 votes). In addition to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, she also polled over 10% in the Collectivity of Saint Martin (12.51%, 665 votes), in New Caledonia (11.66%, 10,409 votes), in Saint Barthélemy (11.41%, 310 votes), in French Guiana (10.48%, 3,920 votes) and in Réunion (10.31%, 37,549 votes). She achieved her lowest regional result in Île-de-France (12.28%, 655,926 votes), her lowest departmental result in Paris (6.20%, 61,503 votes), her lowest overseas result in Wallis and Futuna (2.37%, 152 votes). In addition to Île-de-France, she polled less 15% in Brittany (13.24%, 262,095 votes) and in Pays de la Loire (14.39%, 308,806 votes). In addition to Paris, she polled less 10% in Hauts-de-Seine (8.51%, 62,447 votes). In addition to Wallis and Futuna, she polled less 5% in Mayotte (2.77%, 996 votes) and in Martinique (4.76%, 6,960 votes). A French sociologist, Sylvain Crépon who analysed the social and occupational groups of the FN voters in 2012, explained : ""The FN vote is made up of the victims of globalisation. It is the small shopkeepers who are going under because of the economic crisis and competition from the out-of-town hypermarkets; it is low-paid workers from the private sector; the unemployed. The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet."" Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in ""rural"" areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate commuter belts built on the distant outskirts of the cities : ""The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they can no longer afford to live there. Many of these people will have had recent experience of living in the banlieues (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity."" Commentators also pointed that there are more young people and women voting for the party in 2012. During a speech delivered in Paris on 1 May 2012 after the traditional Joan of Arc and Labor Day march, she has refused to back either incumbent president Sarkozy or socialist Hollande in the run-off on 6 May. Addressing the party's annual rally at Place de l'Opéra, she vowed to cast a blank ballot and told her supporters to vote with their conscience, saying : ""Hollande and Sarkozy – neither of them will save you. On Sunday I will cast a blank protest vote. I have made my choice. Each of you will make yours."" Accusing both candidates of surrendering to Europe and financial markets, she asked : ""Who between Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy will impose the austerity plan in the most servile way? Who will submit the best to the instructions of the IMF, the ECB or the European Commission?"" In the wake of her success, she announced the foundation of the ""Blue Marine Gathering"", an electoral coalition dedicated to the June parliamentary elections. Herself a candidate in the Pas-de-Calais' 11th constituency, she collected 42,36% of the vote, far before the Socialist representative Philippe Kemel (23.50%) and her far-left rival Jean-Luc Mélenchon (21.48%). She was beaten in the second round with 49.86%. She filed an appeal rejected by the constitutional Council which however recognized some proven deceptions. Nationally, her party has only elected two lawmakers : her niece Marion Maréchal-Le Pen and Gilbert Collard. In 2014, she led her party to other success in the municipal and senatorial elections : eleven mayors and two senators were elected. It was the first time the National Front entered in France's upper chamber. On 24 May 2014, the National Front won the European election in France with 24.90% of the vote. Marine Le Pen came in first place in her North-West constituency with a score of 33.60%. 25 FN members were sent at the European Parliament of Strasbourg. They voted against the Juncker Commission in July. One year later, she was able to announce the formation of a group composed of the French National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Italian Lega Nord, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Polish Congress of the New Right, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and former UKIP member Janice Atkinson. Her first attempt to constitute this group in 2014 has failed because of the UKIP refusal and of controversial statements of her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in June. Le Pen sit in the commission for international trade. In 2016, Politico have ranked her second as the most influential MEP after Martin Schulz. In April 2015, her father provoked a political crisis in the National Front because of two interviews he gave. Some controversial statements include his opinion on World War II and on minorities in France. Marine Le Pen organized a postal vote to ask the FN members to change the statuts of the party in order to expel her father. Le Pen père pursued his movement and the justice canceled the vote. On 25 August, the FN executive Office voted his exclusion from the party he has founded forty years earlier. Many observers have concluded on her dependence toward her closest advisor, Florian Philippot, a former left-wing technocrat. A national purge excluded the members refusing the evolution of the FN under Marine Le Pen's leadership. She tardily announced her candidacy for the presidency of the regional council of Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie for the 2015 regional elections. She have regretted the proximity with the next presidential election. On 6 December, she arrived first with 40.6% of the vote. But the Socialist candidate (third with 18.12%) has withdrawed and called to vote for her right-wing opponent Xavier Bertrand who won by 57.80% of the vote. Her niece Marion also lost but got a better score than her. Excepting the candidates for the center-right primary, Marine Le Pen is the first to announce her candidacy for the 2017 French presidential election on 8 April 2016. She has consistently maintained high popularity in polling figures : she is predicted to gather between 28% and 30% in the first round, which is close to the figures predicted for front-runner François Fillon. She has appointed David Rachline, a young FN member of the Senate, as her campaign's manager. The FN have found some difficulties finding funding because of the opposition of every French bank to her anti-globalist activism, obliging it to receive funding from European and world banks (some controversies had flared on some Russian fundings of former FN electoral campaigns). Most of the political analysts notice her strong position because of the absence of primary in her party (consolidating her leadership), of the news such as the migrants crisis or the terrorist attacks in France (reinforcing her political positions) and of the very right-wing campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy in the Republican primary (enlarging her themes). However, she stated she will not officially launch her campaign before February 2017, waiting for the results of the Republican and Socialist primaries, and currently prefers to remain silent in the media and usher thematic think tanks dedicated to the elaboration of her program. In consequence, her rare media appearances attract consistent audiences (2.3 millions viewers for Vie politique on TF1 on 11 September 2016 and 4 millions for Une ambition intime on M6 on 16 October). The communication of her party also attracts the media attention : a new Mitterrand-inspired poster showing her in a rural landscape with the slogan ""Appeased France"" is an attempt to respond to surveys indicating she remains somewhat controversial for an important part of the French electorate. But the mockeries sparked by this poster lead to the change of the slogan : ""In the name of the people"". Others have notice the disappearance of the FN logo and of the name Le Pen on the campaign's posters. In a recent interview with BBC, Le Pen stated that Donald Trump's presidential victory will in fact help her in the 2016-2017 presidential race. In her opinion Mr Trump has ""made possible what had previously been presented as impossible"". Marine Le Pen contends that the FN's immigration programme is better known among the voters; she thus concentrates on the party's economic and social programme. Opposed to free trade and autarky, she advocates protectionism as a median way. In her view, if one considers the economy to be a raging river, then free trade is like allowing the torrent to rush along unchecked; autarky equates to the erection of a dam whereas protectionism is to install a sluice gate. ""Protectionism is not autarky! ... Our position is not extreme – as our opponents would have it believed – but one which favours the middle way"". In 2010, she vigorously criticized the pension plan drawn up by Nicolas Sarkozy and his liberal-conservative government. She paid tribute to the economist Maurice Allais, who died on 9 October 2010. A French laureate of the Nobel Prize in Economics (1988), Allais had expressed concerns about the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the single European currency, free trade and globalization and the 2004 European Constitution. She favours the repeal of the 1973 Pompidou-Giscard Law, which makes it illegal for France to borrow at zero or a low rate of interest from the Banque de France and forces the country to borrow at higher rate on the international financial markets. In her view, the national debt has grown steeply because of this law. She claimed that in 2010 France had already refunded 1.355 trillion euros of accrued interest on loans at a time when the national debt represented around 1.650 trillion euros. She has expressed support for the French public utilities, the civil servants, and the general public interest. She thus opposes the programmed privatization of the French Post Office (La Poste) : in her view, ""the privatization, with the aim of only making profitable, will result in the removal of post offices in the rural areas where the relinquishment of the state is already high"". In October 2009, she claimed that three post offices had already disappeared each day in France since 1 January 2009. She said that the liberalization of the French public utilities had been ratified by the former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin during the Barcelona summit on 15 and 16 March 2002. She had also warned that the UMP government planned a ""progressive privatization of the French Social Security system from 2011"" – a condition imposed by the financial markets. During a press conference in June 2011, she advocated to reintroduce the Havana Charter and implement an ""International Trade Organization"" (in place of World Trade Organization), in order to reorganize the world trade exchanges. Signed by 53 countries and rejected by the US in 1951, this Charter was a trade agreement that would have established an international currency known as the bancor. She claimed that the ""Havana Charters's proposals perfectly fit into her economic philosophy"" and that ""its first article conciliates international trade and employment"". During her speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. in November 2011, she proposed ""three essential solutions to stop the current world systemic crisis and turn the world towards a greater justice and greater prosperity"": reintroduction of a ""polymetallic standard"" in the International monetary systems as a world standard of reference and exchanges in order to establish a ""free monetary system"" and struggle against speculation; the ratification of the modernized Havana Charter by the 1948 signatory nations and incoming emerging countries, in order to favour a ""reasonable protectionism that encourages cooperation in trade among nations through the end of 'unbridled free trade'""; application of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act, which legally separated investment banking and commercial banking, to ""the banking system of each country"". In her view, these solutions will be able to bring a global support for employment thanks to the integration of ""full employment"" appearing as one of the main targets of the Havana Charter and for industry thanks to the authorization of state aids appearing in the Charter's article 13. In October 2011, she advocated to implement a drastic regulation of the banking sector separating by law the deposit banks from the merchant banks. She claimed that ""the deposit banks should be rescued by a temporary and partial nationalization"". In her view, ""the balance sheet of the banks should be the object of a transparency operation"". In October 2011, she suggested 7 measures to save €30 billion per year in order to preserve France's AAA credit rating. The largest part of the measures are made up of avoiding fraud on welfare payments and avoidance of tax loopholes (together €18.5 bn), stopping not useful local spending (€4bn) as well as stopping payments of France to the EU (€7bn). A president of the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF), Laurence Parisot regularly levels strong criticism at the FN's economic and social programme. She replied that ""the FN is not the friend of the CAC 40 and is fighting the social regression brought about by the MEDEF and inflicted on the French people by the allies of the UMP and the PS"". After Parisot's new criticism, she claims that ""the philosophy of the FN's economic project comes down to some words: construction of a strong, protective and strategist state, reasoned protections at the boundaries, support to the small and medium enterprises, and get back the monetary sovereignty, only able to assure France's recovery"". She also replied that ""Laurence Parisot, this is the exact opposite of her democratic and republican project, a project of hope which puts back man and nation in the center of politics"". After the publication of Parisot's critical book relating to the FN economic project, she suggested a ""direct and public debate"" with the president of the MEDEF. In her view, ""the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) after 2013 will be unable to protect our farmers from speculators and savage global competition, or to compensate for the excesses of the multinationals of the food processing industry and large-scale distributors. The CAP after 2013 will remain wedged between the ultraliberal and internationalist market logic of the European Commission and a future ‘green’ CAP, in reality serving the neo-capitalists of ecological business"". During her first visit at the Paris International Agricultural Show on 25 February 2011, Marine Le Pen denounced the CAP as an ""unbearable bureaucracy"" and advocated to replace it with a ""French agricultural policy"". She also claimed that ""leaving the EU, we could allocate 15 billions of euros to our agriculture"". She claims that 'internationalist organisations' such as the EU, FAO, United Nations and G-20 are directly responsible for the food crises throughout the world. She advocates France's food independence with regard to multinationals and ""a realignment of the farm aid politics to the third countries in order to favour their food sovereignty in particular by the reintroduction of localized food crops"". She advocates the implementation of the ""autarky of big spaces"" and an ""economy in concentric circles"". In her view, it is an ""ecological heresy to consume products grown at 20,000 km away and recycle waste thousands km further"". She claims that we should ""produce to the closest"", ""distribute on the spot"", ""consume as a priority products of its region"" and then ""in the nearby region"" if not produced on the spot. She seeks to implement ""contracts of cooperation"" if necessary goods like coffee are not produced in Europe. Marine Le Pen regularly denounces sharp rises in energy prices (gas, gasoline, electricity) which has ""harmful consequences on the purchasing power of the working and middle-class families"". In her view, this rise mainly stems from the European liberalization of the energy sector, jointly implemented by right wing and socialist governments since 1996. She advocates an immediate reduction of 20% of the domestic tax on oil products (TIPP), a surcharge of fantastic profits of the largest gas and oil companies and a struggle against international speculation on basic products such as food and energy. She considers that ""a strong state has authority to be the guarantor of public utilities, being the exclusive owner of the strategic companies of public utility and the regulator of tariffs"". After a fatal event occurred on 12 September 2011 in the Centraco nuclear installation located on the Marcoule Nuclear Site, she claimed that ""this accident illustrated the dangerousness of this energy and the necessity to consider a progressive and well-thought-out exit from nuclear power"". In her view, ""the State must secure the 58 French nuclear power plants and invest in researches to process nuclear waste"". She advocates to ""start the energy diversification of France, in particular with an ambitious programme of research into hydrogen"". She favours accompanied combined transport (ferroutage) and public transport. Marine Le Pen denounces the current corporate tax as ""a crying injustice"". She claims that the main groups of CAC 40 only pay 8% of corporate tax whereas the small offices/home offices, the small and medium enterprises, the craftsmen and the shopkeepers fully pay 33.33%. She advocates to implement a flexible corporate tax according to the use of profits: heavier when the profits benefit the shareholders and lighter when the profits turn towards profit sharing, salaries, employment and productive investment, enabling a relocation of activities. MEP, she holds globalization, intergovernmental organizations, 'euro-mondialism', free trade and ultra-liberalism responsible for the decline of agriculture and the fishing industry, deindustrialization, offshoring and structural unemployment. Advocating a 'Europe of the nations' like a loose confederation of sovereign nation states, she opposes supranationalism, the euro and the eurozone, the technocracy of Brussels, and the EU's federalism. She opposes the establishment of a direct European tax, which is favoured by the leaders of the European Parliament and European Commission. She claims that an indirect European tax already exists, since France is a net annual contributor to the EU budget by up to 7 billion euros annually. She claims that the Treaty of Lisbon is the 'gravedigger of the independence and identity of the European nations' and the 'executioner of public utilities in the name of a cult of profitability and free competition – both mortal enemies of public interest'. In her view, the Treaty of Lisbon is an 'exact copy' of the European Constitution which was twice rejected by referendum: first in France by 54.67% of the voters on 29 May 2005 and then in Netherlands by 61.54% of the voters on 1 June 2005. She thus regretted that the Treaty of Lisbon had been imposed on the French people by parliament in order to avoid another referendum. She also criticized its approval by the Socialist Party. She denounces the Treaty's amending implemented by the EU leaders, notably Germany. In her view, the revision is aimed at ""solving the euro"" and ""forever eliminating the budgetary sovereignty of the states to institute a kind of supranational European monetary fund"". Opposed to the accession of Turkey to the European Union, she prefers the option of a ""privileged partnership"". Marine Le Pen opposes accession of Ukraine to the European Union, while supporting its association status. She is currently campaigning for a referendum on France leaving the EU. She is a strong opponent of the Euro and advocates France to leave the common currency. She claims that the implementation of the Euro entailed a rise in prices and its abandonment would lead to an increase in purchasing power. Quoting economic data from Eurostat (annual average growth, unemployment, GDP gap), she notes that ""the European countries which did not enter the euro display higher performances than countries in the eurozone for ten years"". Interviewed in October 2011 by Adam Boulton on Sky News, she cited the UK's relative stability as an example of how France's economy need not suffer from pulling out of the euro. She noticed that ""United Kingdom is not in the eurozone and does not have the least desire to be in it. UK does not tolerate this kind of taking away of its freedom"". In order to recover monetary sovereignty, she advocates that France should gradually leave the euro with a new conversion rate fixed to 1 euro = 1 franc. In her view, France should jointly negotiate a ""grouped departure"" from the euro and eurozone. This departure should take effect on the same day and include the other European countries (such as Ireland, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium) which are suffering because of the single currency. Since the present government and the whole political class had strongly criticized her economic plan, she submitted a new document detailing how a successful departure of United Kingdom, Spain and Italy from the European Monetary System (EMS) had been achieved from September 1992. She explains the tenet and the mechanism of a competitive devaluation (J curve), which ""will quickly have a positive effect on employment and purchasing power, stimulating industry, international trade and enabling to fight offshorings"". Quoting extracts from a book by the French economist Alain Cotta, she claims that a devaluation of the franc will not bring about inflation. She anticipates a ""total economic federalization of the eurozone"". In her view, ""this option which is favoured by the European technostructure, presents all the features of a totalitarian utopia"". She claims that a ""monstrous superstructure, already named 'European ministry of Finance', would decide in the opaqueness our policies of education, health and security"". In her view, ""the federal headlong rush also supposes a massive financial transfer of our countries towards Southern and Eastern Europe, at the detriment of the most vulnerable French people"". About successive bailout plans, she laments that ""the contributing countries, France in particular, throw in the hole of the European debt billions which dig their deficits and come them closer to the eye of the cyclone"". In her view, ""the hundred of billions paid do not product any result, will not settle any problem, will not rescue a eurozone already in bankruptcy and push France into the chasm of excessive debt, whereas the French debt has already exploded under the mandate of Nicolas Sarkozy"". Fearing that ""France falls into the excessive debt"", she refuses ""any new assistance plan in order to bail out one after the other the countries suffering because of the single currency"". She asserts that despite the expansion of the abilities of the European Financial Stability Facility, reassuring announcements and new austerity plans, Greece is sinking, social devastation is intensifying and the anger of the people bursts out. In July 2011, she claimed that ""after the seventeen billions of the first Greek bailout plan, the fifteen billions of the new assistance plan to Greece will make heavy our own already huge debt"". During her press conference organized on 6 September 2011 at the Pont de la Concorde in front of the National Assembly, she vigorously denounced the favourable voting by Socialist and UMP-NC MPs of second Greek bailout plan. She pledged to pull France out of NATO, saying that the National Front has from day one been opposed to NATO membership. Interviewed in October 2011 by Kommersant, she claimed that ""she believed in a multipolar world"". In her view, France has also to revise its geostrategic relations with the USA. She regularly denounces France's bandwagoning towards the USA. She advocates that France takes its independence towards US and regains the geopolitical independence beloved by Charles de Gaulle. In May 2011, she claimed that the ""old institutions"" such as World Trade Organization, World Bank and International Monetary Fund were ""expired"". In 2011, she advocated the ""replacement of WTO by an 'International Trade Organization', founded on the sane principles of protection, interest of people and support to small and medium enterprises, the 'humbles' faced with the 'powerful' and cartels"". In her view, IMF which ""has become an infernal machine at the service of the ultraliberal ideology, is in its current form an extremely harmful institution"". She claims that ""the structural adjustment plans that IMF imposes on countries where it operates, systematically result in privatization of public utilities, dismantling of the state, drop in salaries and pensions, and removal of protections at boundaries"". In her view, ""citizens are always the first victims of IMF like in Argentina in 2001 and today in Greece"". She claims that ""the in-depth results of IMF are disastrous : rise in debts and sharp increase in rhythm of financial crises for two decades"". She consequently advocates the abolition of IMF. On 28 July 2011, she reacted after the publication of the IMF yearly report on France. In a letter addressed to the managing director of IMF Christine Lagarde, she explained in detail the ""four pillars to get out France of the debt and straighten out our public accounts"". Marine Le Pen advocates to ""vote for the abolition of the law enabling the regularization of the illegal immigrants"". In her view, ""this measure corresponds with the interest of France, the respect of its authority and the most elementary justice"". In July 2011, she wrote an open letter to policemen, gendarmes and customs officers concerning the policy of the fight against illegal immigration. She criticized the ""passivity and inactivity of the UMP government faced with the collapse of expulsions of illegal immigrants"" as well as its ""blind submissiveness to very questionable European injunctions"". Denouncing a ""sharp fall in deportations since the beginning of 2011 after a decrease of near 5% in 2010"", she claimed that ""most of the detention centres are almost empty in 2011"". Advocating the ""return of any foreigner illegally entered to France towards his/her country of origin"", she claims that she ""refuses to give up the fight against illegal immigration"". She favours a ""radical change of politics in order to drastically reduce upstream the influx of illegal immigrants towards France"". In her view, this policy requires to ""cut the 'suction pumps' of illegal immigration while France is in this field one of the most incentive countries in the world"". Implemented in 2000 by Lionel Jospin's government, the aide médicale d'Ėtat (AME) grants free medical care to illegal immigrants. Denouncing a ""state scandal"" and an ""increasing financial black hole for the French social security system"", she ""pledges to repeal the AME as soon as she will come to power"". She claims that, in the wake of selected immigration and then endured immigration, Nicolas Sarkozy is imposing health-care immigration on the French people. In February 2011, she claimed that in the wake of the Arab Spring, Europe and particularly France would be confronted with a surge in illegal immigration. She denounced ""the EU's tragic helplessness to respond to this new migratory challenge"" and ""the EU's inability to face these emergency situations and to control effectively the migratory flows"". Accompanied by the vice-president of the FN Louis Aliot and Mario Borghezio MEP (Lega Nord), she travelled to Lampedusa on 14 March 2011. She met the island's mayor Bernardino De Rubeis (Movement for the Autonomies) and visited a housing center for illegal immigrants. She said that ""Europe can't welcome everyone... We would be pleased to take them all in our boat, but it's not big enough. We'll all go to the bottom. We would be adding one misery to another"" and ""I also want to offer my support to the inhabitants of Lampedusa who have had the feeling of being completely abandoned"". Around 9,000 migrants had already reached Lampedusa by boat since mid-January 2011 when protests in Tunisia unleashed a revolution across the Arab world. During an international press conference held in Rome on 15 March 2011, she explained the situation of illegal immigration in Lampedusa, emphasized ""the helplessness of EU"" and how ""each nation is more efficient to deal with the issue"", and proposed solutions to settle this issue. In order to curb the illegal immigration influx from Tunisia and Libya, she has enjoined Nicolas Sarkozy to announce France's immediate and definitive withdrawal from Schengen Area and to reinstate urgently customs controls in all the borders of the country. She claimed that the UMP government's deceptive announcements about Schengen issue aimed at concealing its political inactivity and attempting to cheat public opinion. In her view, the announcement of a technical adjustment of Schengen Agreement proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi during 26 April 2011 French-Italian summit ""will not settle strictly anything"". Reminding that United Kingdom and Ireland have refused the Agreement, she claims that only the withdrawal from Schengen Area will enable France to re-establish necessary customs controls and stop immigration. She claims that ""traffickers and networks of smugglers thrive when a country does not control its borders"". Marine Le Pen seeks to establish a moratorium on legal immigration. During a press conference on 21 February 2011, she unveiled ""the 2010 real figures of immigration"" based on data transmitted by high-ranking officials of the Minister of the Interior, detailed the welfare benefits to which the legal and illegal immigrants are entitled, and proposed concrete solutions based on working models in the UK and the Netherlands. In July 2011, she claims that ""with 203,000 residence permits allocated in 2010 versus 114,000 in 2000 under Lionel Jospin, the UMP power promotes a laxer than ever policy of legal immigration"". On 28 November 2010, 52.9% of the Swiss voters and 15 5/2 cantons approved the popular initiative ""for the deportation of criminal foreigners"" while the governmental counterproposal was rejected by 54.2% of voters and all the 20 6/2 cantons. She praised ""the great victory of the Swiss people against the ruling elite"". Afterwards, she took part in debates on Radio Suisse Romande (RSR) with the SVP national councillor Oskar Freysinger and then on Radio Cité Genève. Interviewed by The Daily Telegraph, she praised David Cameron's pledge to cut net annual immigration to UK from around 200,000 to ""tens of thousands"". In February 2011, David Cameron expressed a rejection of multiculturalism during a speech at Munich Security Conference. Afterwards, she congratulated him, for what she claimed was an endorsement of the FN's views on the failure of multiculturalism and immigration. In Le Pen's view, citizenship is indivisible from nationality and rests on the equality of all people before the law; the latter should preclude preferential treatment based on the membership of a social, ethnic or religious category. As a result, she favours the repeal of affirmative action and the restoration of the ""republican meritocracy"". She claims that filiation should be the normal route to French nationality, with naturalization the exception: ""nationality is inherited or merited"". In her view, naturalization can only be obtained after a check on the ability of assimilation to republican principles. In order to settle the immigration issue, she advocates a reform of the nationality regulations so as to remove dual citizenship and the automatic acquisition of French nationality. On 30 May 2011, she wrote a letter to the Members of Parliament about dual citizenship: she claimed that ""in the dual citizenship lie one of the main ferments of breach of the republican cohesion that France needs more than ever and a potent brake on the assimilation of French people from immigration"". She favours an enforcement of the law regarding loss of nationality. In her view, a foreigner who does not respect the law in France should be deprived of French nationality; equally any foreigner committing serious crimes and offences in France should be returned to his or her country of origin. She favours a 'French first' policy with regard to employment, welfare and accommodation. Advocating that the FN remains a non-denominational party, Marine Le Pen regularly states her attachment to secularism (laïcité) in French society. She vigorously defends the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, stipulating that the French republic does not recognise, grant a salary to, or subsidise any form of religious worship. She favours a ban on any communitarian or religious demands in schools, and seeks an amendment to the Constitution stating that the French republic does not recognize any community (denominations and ethnic groups). Opposed to the financing of mosques from public funds, she further seeks to deny their financing from foreign assets. In her view, the construction, maintenance and financing of places of worship should be a matter for groups of worshippers operating within a regulated framework. She advocates to implement ""the separation of the mosque and the state"" and opposes the training of Imams by the French republic. On 29 November 2009, 57.5% of Swiss voters and 19 ½ cantons approved the popular initiative ""for a ban on the construction of new minarets"" (without retroactive effect on the four minarets already built in Switzerland). She congratulated the Swiss people on the overwhelming approval of the ban and denounced the ruling elite for its contempt of direct democracy. In February 2010, the fast food chain Quick announced that eight of its franchises would offer exclusively halal meals. This decision immediately triggered a controversy among the French political class from the Socialist Party, the UMP (Lionnel Luca MP) and the FN. The controversy was particularly sharp in Roubaix (Nord): the socialist mayor René Vandierendonck even threatened a lawsuit and she wrote two official statements about the matter. Denouncing an ""accelerated policy of Islamisation"" and a ""breach of the constitutional principle of secularism"", she claimed that Quick had been owned by the French state since October 2006 and that the UMP state is the owner of Quick through the Caisse des dépôts et consignations (Qualium Investissement subsidiary), which holds 99.63% of its capital. Interviewed by Radio 1 in June 2011, she said that unlike the leader of the PVV Geert Wilders, she is ""not waging war against Islam"" and ""is fighting the Islamisation of French society"". Emphasizing her divergence with the Dutch MP, she claimed: ""That's the difference between Geert Wilders and me. He reads the Qur’an literally: you can’t interpret the Qur’an – or indeed the Bible – literally. I resist fundamentalists who want to impose their will and law on France. Sharia Law is not compatible with our principles, our values or democracy."" Marine Le Pen supports keeping abortion legal, and opposes efforts to abolish public subsidies for abortion. However, she believes that abortion is a serious moral issue that is too often regarded as trivial by French culture. Le Pen opposes the repeal of the 1975 Veil Law (Loi Veil) which framed abortion in a restrictive legislative provision. She claims that an unfavorable socio-economic background is a determining factor for the majority of women who have undergone an abortion. Consequently, she advocates a strongly pro-family policy more conducive to the nurturing and raising of children. Favourable to a policy aimed at increasing the birth rate, she explains her views on abortion in her autobiography À contre flots. She is strictly opposed to any softening of the law against euthanasia. She supports a referendum on whether to reinstate capital punishment in France, which was abolished in 1981. The electorate would have the choice between restoring the death penalty and introduce a 'real' life imprisonment (without parole). Currently, French lifers are eligible for parole after serving 18 to 22 years, except in small number of cases. On the 70th anniversary of the Appeal of 18 June, Marine Le Pen held a press conference at the FN's headquarters. Drawing a parallel with the fall of France in June 1940, she denounced the weakening of the nation state, German domination within the EU and subservience to Atlanticism. Her goal was to ""become the personification of national ambition and to return to France a spirit of greatness and an awareness of its place in history"". She remains committed to France's territorial sovereignty, including the Overseas departments and territories. During a debate on Radio Cité Genève with Éric Bertinat, an SVP member of the Grand Council of Geneva, she vigorously opposed his proposal that the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie be incorporated into Switzerland. During her opening speech, she reminded that France is present in three oceans and possesses the second-largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 11 million km2 During her opening speech, she also emphasized the importance of the French language and Francophonie. She claimed that ""our national language is spreading through the five continents, privilege that it shares only with English"" and that ""the Francophonie has to vibrate in the lands of Asia, Americas, Europe and Africa again"". In April 2011, she wrote a letter to all the prefects of France. She denounced ""the weakening of the state"", ""the discouragement of its personnels"" and ""the ineffectiveness of its governance"". She claimed that the history of France shows us that as soon as there is a gap of the state, the local baronies reconstruct. She proposed a politic of re-establishment of the state which will lean on the high-ranking and devoted civil servants. In a referendum on becoming an overseas department held on 29 March 2009, 95.22% of the Mahoran voters approved the change of status. An overseas collectivity from 2003, Mayotte became France's 101st department on 31 March 2011. A third of the population of Mayotte are illegal migrants, mostly from the nearby islands of the archipelago which make up the independent Comoran state. In her view, the accession of Mayotte to an overseas department will create a new in-draught for illegal immigration, which constitutes a threat for the stability of the island. She claims that the departmental status of the island requires the relinquishment of the jus soli wished in 2005 by François Baroin, then Minister of Overseas and the implementation of the 'French first' policy in the granting of welfare aids. Reasserting her unshakeable attachment to French Caledonia, she stated that ""New Caledonia is in France and must stay there"". In her view, ""the creation of a citizenship and an acknowledgment of a 'Kanak identity' organize a true dismemberment of the sovereignty and a breach of the unity of the French republic"". In June 2010, she claimed that ""the official acknowledgment of the flag of the separatists of FNLKS as emblem of New Caledonia would constitute an affront to France and would show the true will of the UMP government to get rid of this French territory"". She stated that ""the only flag of New Caledonia, a French territory, is the French flag in accordance with the article 2 of the French constitution"". In February 2011, she again claimed that ""the controversial solution of the two flags, contrary to the Nouméa Accord, which was supported by the Prime Minister François Fillon, is an additional proof of the will of the government and Nicolas Sarkozy to want to get rid of a part of France"". She advocates forging a privileged partnership with Russia. She claims that a French-Russian partnership is necessitated by ""obvious civilization and geostrategic factors"" as well as France's ""energy security interests"". In her view, ""France's interests are in Europe, but in Great Europe, especially including its partnership with Russia"". Interviewed by Kommersant, she claimed that ""the process of demonization of Russia is taking place at the level of the EU leadership and at the wishes of the US, which is trying to create a unipolar world."" Interviewed about democracy in Russia and Vladimir Putin, she replied: ""We also do not have an ideal democracy in France and, therefore, do not have the right to give Russia lessons in democracy. But I openly admit that, to some extent, I admire Vladimir Putin. He makes mistakes, but who doesn’t? The situation in Russia is complicated, and one cannot expect all the problems stemming from the collapse of the Soviet Union to be quickly resolved – they require time. I think that Vladimir Putin has principles and a vision of the future that is necessary to ensure Russia's prosperity, which it deserves. She claims that the Front National is a ""patriotic"" party with more in common with the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and its ""opposition to the totalitarian character of the EU and its desire to remove people's sovereignty"" than with the British National Party (BNP). On 8 June 2011, Marine Le Pen and the leader of the Freedom Party of Austria Heinz-Christian Strache held in the European Parliament a joint press conference about ""globalization, migration and economic threats in the EU"". Both are aiming at strengthening the ties between their two respective movements and also with other eurosceptic parties. In a statement written on 20 July 2011, she wrote that ""If Belgium is going to split, if Flanders pronounces its independence, which seems more and more credible a possibility, the French republic would do well to welcome Wallonia to its heart."" She said that ""on this eve of the Belgian National Day, it is nevertheless the responsibility of France and the French to extend a hand to the Walloons"". She claimed that ""the historic and fraternal links that unite our two people are too strong for France to abandon the Walloons"". She suggested any such plan to become part of France should be agreed by a referendum in both countries. In a statement about the 2011 Norway attacks, she reiterated her condolences to the Norwegian people and recalled her determination to fight mercilessly against all forms of violence and barbarity. In reply to a MRAP's statement, she claimed that ""the Norwegian slaughter was the work of a lone lunatic who must be ruthlessly punished"". In October 2011, after her resignation from the Alliance of European National Movements (AENM), she joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF), a Pan-European sovereigntist platform created in late 2010. In October 2011, she denounced a ""violence wave"" in Tunisia and ""numerous deadly attacks"" perpetrated against the Copt minority in Egypt. She claimed that ""the revolutions in Maghreb, which have been led in the name of freedom and human rights, turned into a democratic fiasco and the eruption of violent islamist movements"". In her view, ""these violent attacks illustrate the extreme fragility of the democratic processes in countries faced with the growing influence of radical islamist movements and the threats that hang over individual freedom"". She also ""expressed deepest concern faced with the possibility of seeing to surge islamist dictatorships on Europe's doorstep"". About the situation in Libya, she claimed that the confrontations pertained to a civil war in which France's interest was not to interfere. She regretted the haste of the French diplomacy which had ""prematurely recognized the National Transitional Council which spoke in the name of the Libyan rebels"". She claimed that the transfer of the US command towards NATO increased the submissiveness of the French Armed Forces. Denouncing ""the US supremacy"" in the military intervention, she ""refused the idea that France slavishly followed the USA in this new stalemate"". One month after the launching of hostilities, she claimed that ""France mired into the 'vote-catching war' of Sarkozy"". She noticed that ""the United Nations' mandate had largely been overstepped"", that ""the war dragged on"" and that ""the deaths of civilians increased"". Denouncing the planned dispatch of British, French and Italian military advisers, she lamented the decision of French authorities to compromise further France in ""a new Afghanistan"". Interviewed by the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz about the fact that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said : ""The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist"". She also opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: ""The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions"". In a statement about the death of Osama bin Laden, she welcomed his ""salutary elimination"" and claimed that his execution was ""a right and appropriate answer to the death of the victims in the 2011 Marrakech bombing"". She regularly claims that France should promptly withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. Marine Le Pen claims that ""with the help or the protection of western major powers (including France in front row), Africa became for the decolonization a privileged ground of all the lobbies which maintain on its territory unacceptable, criminal and 'neo-colonialist' networks of corruption"". She also claims that ""whereas Africa struggles to find the ways of growth and thus future prosperity, whereas starvation or disease decimate millions of innocent souls, whereas skillfully maintained conflicts discourage the most dynamic and talented African elites, French-African relations are marred by an unforgivable misdemeanour: corruption"". She advocates to ""have a dialogue with Africa in line with our common history and our mutual interests"" and ""implement a real partnership which enables a harmonious development of the African continent"". In her view, ""the only reasonable way lies in a close relationship between the European and African continents, because the development of the African continent will break the migratory stranglehold which threats us and enable the two continents to live their own identities in peace, security and prosperity"". She claimed that only diplomacy, negotiation and consultation were able to settle the tangle of the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis, which had begun in the aftermath of the run-off of the 2010 presidential election, when both Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara have claimed victory and taken the presidential oath of office. Interviewed in January 2011 by the monthly panafrican magazine Première Ligne, she denounced the interference of France and the international community in internal politics of Côte d'Ivoire and criticized Nicolas Sarkozy's support for Alassane Ouattara as a ""political mistake"". Denouncing a ""double standards diplomacy"", she claimed that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is not legitimate to decide a military intervention in Côte d'Ivoire since it had not intervened in Niger after the coup d'état led by Salou Djibo on 18 February 2010. In parliamentary questions addressed to the European Commission, she denounced the violation of the article 5 of the fourth complementary agreement to Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which had planned the completion of disarmament and reunification of Côte d'Ivoire before the organization of elections. On 12 September 2011, she strongly criticised that the Rwandan president Paul Kagame be received by Nicolas Sarkozy. She claimed that ""welcoming Kagame whose regime is accused in a United Nations report of 'crimes against humanity' against civilian populations in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sarkozy once more demonstrated his contempt for law and justice"". She also claimed, that ""accepting to receive Kagame in Paris, he sullied the reputation of the French army outrageously accused by Kigali of having taken part in the Rwandan Genocide. The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Ukrainian Crisis. The National Front denounces anti-Russian sentiment in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to NATO's interests in the region. Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia: ""European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation."" She argues that the United States are leading a new Cold War against Russia. She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organize a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy. She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nations. According to Russian media, Le Pen has promised to recognize the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea (from Ukraine) in case she is elected President of France. On 3 January 2017 she told BFM TV ""I do not believe that there was an illegal annexation: there was a referendum, the citizens of Crimea wanted to join Russia."" In the 2009 election, Marine Le Pen led the FN list in the North-West France's constituency. Attaining the best result among the seven FN European lists, her list polled 10.18% (253,009 votes) and only won one of the ten seats of MEP. Her list achieved its highest regional result in Picardy (12.57%, 63,624 votes), its highest departmental result in Aisne (13.40%, 19,125 votes), its highest municipal results in Pas-de-Calais : Hénin-Beaumont (27.92%, 1,799 votes), Courcelles-lès-Lens (26.57%), Noyelles-Godault (24.72%). Her list also polled over 10% in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (10.90%, 115,350 votes) and in four other departments : Pas-de-Calais (12.88%, 52,671 votes), Oise (12.46%, 24,997 votes), Somme (11.99%, 19,502 votes), Eure (10.06%, 15,793 votes). In the 2004 election, she led the FN list in the Île-de-France's constituency. Her list polled 8.58% (234,893 votes) and only won one of the fourteen seats of MEP. At the age of 24, she was for the first time a parliamentary candidate in the Paris' 16th constituency (17th arrondissement of Paris). Whereas Bernard Pons was re-elected as MP with 63.14% (22,545 votes) in the first round, she arrived in third position with 11.10% (3,963 votes) behind the socialist candidate (11.85%, 4,233 votes). In the 2002 election, she was a candidate at Lens in the Pas-de-Calais' 13th constituency. There are many workers and unemployed people in this economically deprived constituency, one of the socialist strongholds in northern France. She polled 24.24% (10,228 votes) in the first round and achieved 32.30% (12,266 votes) in the run-off whereas her socialist challenger Jean-Claude Bois polled 38.20% (16,120 votes) in the first round and was re-elected as MP with 67.70% (27,510 votes) in the run-off. In the 2007 election, Marine Le Pen and her substitute Steeve Briois, who emphasise the importance of local politics, represented the FN at Hénin-Beaumont in the Pas-de-Calais' 14th constituency. Located in the former coal mining area, this constituency is characterized by a higher level of unemployment than the national average, a significant number of citizens in recipient of welfare such as the Revenu minimum d'insertion (RMI) and the closure of important factories like Metaleurop North with the loss of 870 jobs. A few months previously, Steeve Briois had asked her to contest this constituency, one of the socialist strongholds in northern France. Explaining the choice of this area, she declared that the constituency was symbolic, with unemployment, offshoring and insecurity representing the major problems of France. Asserting his disappointment with the incumbent socialist MP Albert Facon, Daniel Janssens, who had been a socialist activist for thirty years and a first deputy mayor of Leforest for 24 years, led her support committee during the electoral campaign. Among the fourteen candidates running in the first round, she came second with 24.47% (10,593 votes) whereas Facon came top with 28.24% (12,221 votes). In order to take part in the run-off, a parliamentary candidate must cross the minimal threshold of 12.50% of the registered voters. Throughout France, she thus was the only FN candidate able to compete in a run-off. Between the first round and the run-off, she received the support of historic figures of Gaullism like Alain Griotteray, Michel Caldagués and the souverainiste MEP Paul-Marie Coûteaux. In the run-off, she achieved 41.65% (17,107 votes) winning 17.18% and 6,514 votes within a week whereas Albert Facon was re-elected as MP with 58.35% (23,965 votes). She attained her highest results in three municipalities: Courcelles-lès-Lens (48.71%), Noyelles-Godault (47.85%), Hénin-Beaumont (44.54%, 4,729 votes). Her results in the first round and the run-off are higher than those of Steeve Briois in 2002 (20.06%, 8,768 votes; 32.08%, 12,129 votes) whereas Facon lost 9.57% and 1,718 votes within five years (67.92%, 25,683 votes). According to political analysts, she confirmed her excellent showing in this economically deprived area achieving a very high percentage of votes thanks to economic and social matters like deindustrialization, unemployment and a feeling of abandonment rather than issues such as immigration and insecurity. Marine Le Pen represented as the FN leader at Pas-de-Calais' 11th constituency, where the new constitution regrouped Henin-Beaumont, had her best score in the presidential election. She will be opposed to Philippe Kemel and Jean-Luc Mélenchon. On the first round on 10 June 2012, She finished first with 42,36% (22 280 votes). She was defeated in the second round by Philippe Kemel of the Socialist Party. In 2014, the Criminal Court of Bethune found Marine Le Pen guilty of fraud and sentenced her a 10,000 Euro fine, for producing and distributing flyers purporting to be from electoral opponent Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the 2012 election. In a statement, her counsel Wallerand de Saint-Just announced that she was appealing the conviction. In the 2010 elections, Marine Le Pen led the FN regional list in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and the departmental list in Pas-de-Calais whereas Steeve Briois figured in second position. Largely spread during the electoral campaign, her regional programme included several topics about social, economic, political and cultural issues. In the first round, her list polled 18.31% (224.871 votes) and arrived in third position in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. In Pas-de-Calais, her list polled 19.81% (96,556 votes) overtaking the one of the UMP (15.91%, 77,550 votes) and largely came top in Hénin-Beaumont (39.08%, 2,949 votes). Whereas Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN list attained 20.30% (296,283 votes) in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, she nationally achieved the second highest result among the FN regional lists. In Pas-de-Calais, her result was higher in percentage than the one of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of the 2002 presidential election (18.41%, 135,330 votes). In order to take part in the run-off, a regional list must cross the minimal threshold of 10% of the valid votes. In the run-off, her list polled 22.20% (301,190 votes) and arrived in third position in Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Eighteen FN councillors were elected among the 113 of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais' regional council. Whereas Jean-Marie Le Pen's list attained 22.87% (387,374 votes) with 21 councillors elected, she nationally achieved the second highest result among the FN regional lists. In Pas-de-Calais, her list polled 24.37% (130,720 votes) overtaking the one of the UMP (22.63%, 121,365 votes) and achieved its highest municipal results in Hénin-Beaumont (44.23%, 3,829 votes) and Courcelles-lès-Lens (40.60%). Her list nationally realized the second highest departmental FN result behind Vaucluse (26.54%). Her regional result and the one in Pas-de-Calais were higher in percentage than those of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the run-off of the 2002 presidential election (21.89%, 445,357 votes; 22.17%, 170,967 votes). Thanks to her political success, she confirmed her regional presence and reinforced her internal position within the FN. As a member of the standing committee and a president of the regional group (Front National/Gathering for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais), she led a resolute opposition facing the left-wing regional executive managed by Daniel Percheron. In the 2004 elections, she led the FN regional list in Île-de-France and the departmental list in Hauts-de-Seine. Her list polled 12.26% (448,983 votes) in the first round and achieved 10.11% (395,565 votes) with fifteen councillors elected in the run-off. She exercised the leadership of her regional group for five years and left it in February 2009 since she preferred to devote her energy to the European election campaign in the North-West France's constituency. A member of the standing committee, she led a strong opposition facing the left-wing regional executive managed by Jean-Paul Huchon. In the 1998 elections, she figured on the FN list in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and was a regional councillor for six years (1998–2004). Since 2001, Gérard Dalongeville has been the mayor of Hénin-Beaumont, an economically deprived town in a former coal mining area. A municipal councillor since 1995, Steeve Briois led the FN list while Marine Le Pen was in second position. The FN list came second with 28.53% (3,650 votes) in the first round and achieved 28.83% (3,630 votes) with five councillors elected in the run-off. In order to take part in the run-off, a municipal list must cross the minimal threshold of 10% of the votes cast. Despite their electoral failure, Steeve Briois and Marine Le Pen led a sharp opposition against the re-elected mayor Gérard Dalongeville, his first vice-mayor Marie-Noëlle Lienemann and their left-wing team. A municipal by-election was held in Hénin-Beaumont on 28 June and 5 July 2009. Like in 2008, Steeve Briois was the FN top candidate whereas she figured in second position. The FN list was largely in the lead with 39.33% (4,485 votes) in the first round and achieved 47.62% (5,504 votes) with eight councillors elected in the run-off. Despite a weekly increase of 1,019 votes, the FN again failed its attempt to win the municipality. Steeve Briois, Marine Le Pen and the six other FN councillors led the sole political opposition against the new mayor Daniel Duquenne and his successor Eugène Binaisse. On 24 February 2011, she resigned as a municipal councillor because of the law on the accumulation of mandates (""cumul des mandats""). In a letter entitled ""I stay in Hénin-Beaumont!"", she explained that her political action is more efficient for the city at regional and European levels than in the municipal council. Member of the European Parliament in the Île-de-France constituency (20 July 2004 – 13 July 2009) : Non-Inscrits (20 July 2004 – 14 January 2007/14 November 2007 – 13 July 2009) ; Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (15 January 2007 – 13 November 2007). Member of the European Parliament in the North-West France constituency : Non-Inscrits (14 July 2009 – 16 June 2015); ENF (French) (French)  Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: ​; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who led the National Front party from its foundation in 1972 until 2011. His progression in the late 1980s is known as the ""Lepénisation des esprits"" or ""Le Pen-isation"" of spirits due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. He advocates immigration restrictions, the death penalty, raising incentives for homemakers, and euroscepticism. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the ""Devil of the Republic"" among his opponents or as the ""last samurai in politics"" among his supporters. His progress to the second round in the 21 April 2002 presidential election left its mark on French public life, and the ""21st of April"" is now a frequently used expression in France. His longevity in politics and his five attempts to become president of France have made him a major figure in French political life. He was expelled from the party by his daughter Marine Le Pen on 20 August 2015 after new controversial statements and found himself marginalized in the French political landscape.   Jean-Marie Le Pen was born on 20 June 1928 in La Trinité-sur-Mer, a small seaside village in Brittany, the son of Anne Marie Hervé and Jean Le Pen, a fisherman. He was orphaned as an adolescent (pupille de la nation, brought up by the state), when his father's boat was blown up by a mine in 1942. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and studied at the Jesuit high school François Xavier in Vannes, then at the lycée of Lorient. In November 1944, aged 16, he was turned down (because of his age) by Colonel Henri de La Vaissière (then representative of the Communist Youth) when he attempted to join the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). He then entered the faculty of law in Paris, and started to sell the monarchist Action Française's newspaper, ""Aspects de la France"", in the street. He was repeatedly convicted of assault (coups et blessures). Le Pen started his political career as the head of the student union in Toulouse. He became president of the Association corporative des étudiants en droit, an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the ""Cocos"" (communists). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951. After his time in the military, he studied political science and law at Panthéon-Assas University. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945 or ""The anarchist movement in France since 1945"". After receiving his law diploma, he enlisted in the army in the Foreign Legion. He arrived in Indochina after the 1954 battle of Dien Bien Phu, which had been lost by France and which prompted prime minister Pierre Mendès France to put an end to the war at the Geneva Conference. Le Pen was then sent to Suez in 1956, but arrived only after the cease-fire. In 1953, a year before the beginning of the Algerian War, he contacted President Vincent Auriol, who approved Le Pen's proposed volunteer disaster relief project after a flood in the Netherlands. Within two days, there were 40 volunteers from his university, a group that would later help victims of an earthquake in Italy. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the National Assembly as a member of Pierre Poujade's UDCA populist party. Le Pen, 28 years old, was the youngest member of the Assembly. In 1957, he became the General Secretary of the National Front of Combatants, a veterans' organization, as well as the first French politician to nominate a Muslim candidate, Ahmed Djebbour, an Algerian, elected in 1957 as deputy of Paris. The next year, following his break with Poujade, Le Pen was reelected to the National Assembly as a member of the Centre National des Indépendants et Paysans (CNIP) party, led by Antoine Pinay. Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the 1958 election campaign. Testimonies suggest however that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost the sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness. (Popular belief that he wears a glass eye is unfounded.) During the 1950s, Le Pen took a close interest in the Algerian War (1954–62) and the French defence budget. Elected deputy of the French Parliament under the Poujadist banner, Le Pen voluntarily reengaged himself for two to three months in the French Foreign Legion. He was then sent to Algeria (1957) as an intelligence officer. He has been accused of having engaged in torture. Le Pen has denied these accusations, although he admitted knowing of its use. Le Pen directed the 1965 presidential campaign of far-right candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, who obtained 5.19% of the votes. He insisted on the rehabilitation of the Collaborationists, declaring that: In 1962, Le Pen lost his seat at the Assembly. He created the Serp (Société d’études et de relations publiques) firm, a company involved in the music industry, which produced both chorals of the CGT trade-union and songs of the Popular Front and Nazi marches. The firm was condemned in 1968 for ""praise of war crime and complicity"" after the diffusion of songs from the Third Reich. In 1972, Le Pen founded the Front National (FN) party, along with former OAS member Jacques Bompard, former Collaborationist Roland Gaucher and others nostalgics of Vichy France, neo-Nazi pagans, Traditionalist Catholics, and others. Le Pen presented himself for the first time in the 1974 presidential election, obtaining 0.74% of the vote. In 1976, his Parisian flat was dynamited (he lived at that time in his castle of Montretout in Saint-Cloud). The crime was never solved. Le Pen then failed to obtain the 500 signatures from ""grand electors"" (grands électeurs, mayors, etc.) necessary to present himself in the 1981 presidential election, won by the candidate of the Socialist Party (PS), François Mitterrand. Criticizing immigration and taking advantage of the economic crisis striking France and the world since the 1973 oil crisis, Le Pen's party managed to increase its support in the 1980s, starting in the municipal elections of 1983. His popularity has been greatest in the south of France. The FN obtained 10% in the 1984 European elections. A total of 34 FN deputies entered the Assembly after the 1986 elections (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing Jacques Chirac to Matignon in the first cohabitation government (that is, the combination of a right-wing Prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist President, Mitterrand). In 1984, Le Pen won a seat in the European Parliament and has been constantly reelected since then. In 1988 he lost his reelection bid for the French National Assembly in the Bouches-du-Rhône's 8th constituency. He was defeated in the second round by Socialist Marius Masse. In 1991 Le Pen's invite to London by Conservative MP's was militantly protested by large numbers coordinated by the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe, CAFE, which led to a surge of anti-fascist groups and activity across Europe. In 1992 and 1998 he was elected to the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur. Le Pen ran in the French presidential elections in 1974, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. As noted above, he was not able to run for office in 1981, having failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. In the presidential elections of 2002, Le Pen obtained 16.86% of the votes in the first round of voting. This was enough to qualify him for the second round, as a result of the poor showing by the PS candidate and incumbent prime minister Lionel Jospin and the scattering of votes among 15 other candidates. This was a major political event, both nationally and internationally, as it was the first time someone with such far right views had qualified for the second round of the French presidential elections. There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion as virtually the entire French political spectrum from the centre-right to the left united in fierce opposition to Le Pen's ideas. More than one million people in France took part in street rallies; slogans such as ""vote for the crook, not the fascist"" were heard in opposition to Le Pen. Le Pen was then defeated by a large margin in the second round, when incumbent president Jacques Chirac obtained 82% of the votes, thus securing the biggest majority in the history of the Fifth Republic. In the 2004 regional elections, Le Pen intended to run for office in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region but was prevented from doing so because he did not meet the conditions for being a voter in that region: he neither lived there nor was registered as a taxpayer there. However, he was planned to be the FN's top candidate in the region for the 2010 regional elections. Le Pen again ran in the 2007 French presidential election and finished fourth. His 2007 campaign, at the age of 78 years and 9 months, makes him the oldest candidate for presidential office in French history. After he left office in January 2011, his daughter Marine Le Pen was elected by the adherents of the party against Bruno Gollnisch. He became honorary chairman of the party and won his seat again at the European elections in 2014. On 4 May 2015, he was suspended from the party. This came after he refused to attend his disciplinary hearing at the party for describing the gas chambers used in concentration camps during the Holocaust as a ""detail"" of history.  But Jean-Marie Le Pen won two legal cases: the first one decided in June to cancel this dismissal of membership and the second one decided in July to stop voting operation. On 10 July 2015, the members of his party were to vote to accept or reject a whole series of measures aiming at changing the National Front's status including the Honorary Presidency of Jean-Marie Le Pen. But on 8 July 2015, another French court ruled to suspend the vote and urged the party to organize a Congress in presence of its members as Jean Marie Le Pen sued the National Front again. The party decided to appeal against both of these decisions. Although a French court decided to suspend the vote of its members, the FN decided, on 29 July 2015, to count the votes on the suppression of his Honorary Presidency, which showed that 94% of the members were in favor of this decision. In August 2015, Le Pen was expelled from the National Front after a special party congress. His marriage (29 June 1960 – 18 March 1987) to Pierrette Lalanne (fr) resulted in three daughters; these daughters have given him nine granddaughters. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude in the French edition of Playboy to ridicule him. Marie-Caroline, another of his daughters, also broke with Le Pen, following her husband to join Bruno Mégret, who split from the FN to found MNR, the rival Mouvement National Républicain (National Republican Movement). The youngest of Le Pen's daughters, Marine Le Pen, is leader of the Front National. On 31 May 1991, Jean-Marie Le Pen married Jeanne-Marie Paschos (""Jany""), of Greek descent. Born in 1933, Paschos was previously married to Belgian businessman Jean Garnier. In 1977, Le Pen inherited a fortune from Hubert Lambert (1934-1976), son of the cement industrialist Leon Lambert (1877-1952), one of three sons of Lambert Cement founder Hilaire Lambert. Hubert Lambert was a political supporter of Le Pen, as well as being a monarchist. Lambert's will provided 30 million francs (approximatively 5 million euros) to Le Pen, as well as his opulent three-storey 11-room mansion at 8 Parc de Montretout, Saint-Cloud (the home had been built by Napoleon III for his chief of staff Jean-Francois Mocquard. With his wife, he also owns a two-story townhouse on the Rue Hortense in Rueil-Malmaison and another house in his hometown of La Trinité-sur-Mer. In the early 1980s, Le Pen's personal security was assured by KO International Company, a subsidiary of VHP Security, a private security firm, and an alleged front organisation for SAC, the Service d'Action Civique (Civic Action Service), a Gaullist organisation. SAC allegedly employed figures with organized crime backgrounds and from the far-right movement. National Assembly of France Municipal Council European Parliament Regional Council Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times at home and abroad of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. A Paris court found in February 2005 that his verbal criticisms, such as remarks disparaging Muslims in a 2003 Le Monde interview, were ""inciting racial hatred"", and he was fined 10,000 euros and ordered to pay an additional 5,000 euros in damages to the Ligue des droits de l'homme (League for Human Rights). The conviction and fines were upheld by the Court of Cassation in 2006. Arguing that his party includes people of various ethnic or religious origins like Jean-Pierre Cohen, Farid Smahi or Huguette Fatna, he has attributed some anti-Semitism in France to the effects of Muslim immigration to Europe and suggested that some part of the Jewish community in France might eventually come to appreciate National Front ideology. Le Pen has made statements denying climate change and linking climate science and communism. Le Pen has made several provocative statements concerning the Holocaust which have been interpreted by the legal system as constituting Holocaust denial. He has been convicted of racism or inciting racial hatred at least six times. Thus, on 13 September 1987 he said, ""I ask myself several questions. I'm not saying the gas chambers didn't exist. I haven't seen them myself. I haven't particularly studied the question. But I believe it's just a detail in the history of World War II."" He was condemned under the Gayssot Act to pay 1.2 million francs (183,200 euros). In 1997, the European Parliament, of which Le Pen was then a member, removed his parliamentary immunity so that Le Pen could be tried by a German court for comments he made at a December 1996 press conference before the German Republikaner party. Echoing his 1987 remarks in France, Le Pen stated: ""If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail."" In June 1999, a Munich court found this statement to be ""minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews,"" and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks. Le Pen retorted ironically: ""I understand now that it's the Second World War which is a detail of the history of the gas chambers."" Although war crimes committed during the Algerian War are amnestied in France, this was publicised by the newspapers Le Canard Enchaîné, Libération, and Le Monde, and by Michel Rocard (ex-Prime Minister) on TV (TF1 1993). Le Pen sued the papers and Michel Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the Cour de cassation (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the statute of limitations, there can be no criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (French Communist Party) for the same reason. Le Pen has been a vocal critic of the European Reform Treaty (formally known as the Treaty of Lisbon) which was signed by EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009. In October 2007, Le Pen suggested that he would personally visit the Republic of Ireland to assist the ""No"" campaign but finally changed his mind, fearing that his presence would be used against the supporters of the NO vote. Ireland finally refused to ratify the treaty. Ireland is the only EU country which had a citizen referendum. All other EU states, including France, ratified the treaty by parliamentary vote, despite a previous citizen referendum where over 55% of French voters rejected the European Reform Treaty (although that vote was on a different draft of the Treaty in the form of the Constitutional Treaty). After the Irish ""No"" vote, Le Pen addressed the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, accusing him of furthering the agenda of a ""cabal of international finance and free market fanatics."" Ireland has since accepted the treaty in a second Lisbon referendum. Le Pen is often nicknamed the ""Menhir"", due to his ""granitic nature"" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse. However Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France, and opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion. Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as ""neither right, nor left, but French"" (ni droite, ni gauche, français). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the ""socialo-communists"" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself ""socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French"" (socialement à gauche, économiquement à droite, nationalement français). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the ""establishment"" and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the ""Gang of Four"" (la bande des quatre – an allusion to the Gang of Four during China's Cultural Revolution). Some of Le Pen's statements led other right-wing groups, such as the Austrian Freedom Party, and some National Front supporters, to distance themselves from him. Controversial Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, who has often been accused of being far-right, has also criticized Le Pen. Bruno Mégret left the National Front to found his own party (the National Republican Movement, MNR), claiming that Le Pen kept the Front away from the possibility of gaining power. Mégret wanted to emulate Gianfranco Fini's success in Italy by making it possible for right-wing parties to ally themselves with the Front, but claimed that Le Pen's attitude and outrageous speech prevented this. Le Pen's daughter Marine leads an internal movement of the Front that wants to ""normalize"" the National Front, ""de-enclave"" it, have a ""culture of government"" etc.; however, relations with Le Pen and other supporters of the hard line are complex. Over the years, Le Pen gained widespread popularity among neo-Nazis and white nationalists throughout Europe, North America and South America. As Le Pen, like many other European nationalists in recent years, has made statements highly critical of American foreign policy and culture for which he has received notice from American conservatives. Conservative commentator and author Ann Coulter called him an anti-American adulterer but said his anti-immigration, anti-Muslim message ""finally hit a nerve with voters"" after years of irrelevance. Paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan contends that even though Le Pen ""made radical and foolish statements,"" the EU violated his right to freedom of speech. Buchanan wrote: Jean-Marie Le Pen is the subject or the inspiration for some protest songs.   "
6,Iran Nuclear Deal,"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) (Persian: برنامه جامع اقدام مشترک‎, translit. barnāme jāme‘ eqdām moshtarak‎, acronym: برجام BARJAM), known commonly as the Iran deal or Iran nuclear deal, is an international agreement on the nuclear program of Iran reached in Vienna on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States—plus Germany), and the European Union. Formal negotiations toward the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program began with the adoption of the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in November 2013. For the next twenty months, Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations, and in April 2015 agreed on an Iran nuclear deal framework for the final agreement and in July 2015, Iran and the P5+1 agreed on the plan. Under the agreement, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. For the next 15 years, Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid proliferation risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related economic sanctions.   A nuclear weapon uses a fissile material to cause a nuclear chain reaction. The most commonly used materials have been uranium 235 (U-235) and plutonium 239 (P-239). Both uranium 233 (U-233) and reactor-grade plutonium have also been used. The amount of uranium or plutonium needed depends on the sophistication of the design, with a simple design requiring approximately 15 kg of uranium or 6 kg of plutonium and a sophisticated design requiring as little as 9 kg of uranium or 2 kg of plutonium. Plutonium is almost nonexistent in nature, and natural uranium is about 99.3% uranium 238 (U-238) and 0.7% U-235. Therefore, to make a weapon, either uranium must be enriched, or plutonium must be produced. Uranium enrichment is also frequently necessary for nuclear power. For this reason, uranium enrichment is a dual-use technology, a technology which ""can be used both for civilian and for military purposes"". Key strategies to prevent proliferation of nuclear arms include limiting the number of operating uranium enrichment plants and controlling the export of nuclear technology and fissile material. Iranian development of nuclear technology began in the 1970s, when the U.S. Atoms for Peace program began providing assistance to Iran, which was then led by the Shah. Iran signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1968 as a non-nuclear weapons state and ratified the NPT in 1970. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution took place, and Iran's nuclear program, which had developed some baseline capacity, fell to disarray as ""much of Iran's nuclear talent fled the country in the wake of the Revolution."" Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was initially opposed to nuclear technology; and Iran engaged in a costly war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988. Starting in the later 1980s, Iran restarted its nuclear program, with assistance from Pakistan (which entered into a bilateral agreement with Iran in 1992), China (which did the same in 1990), and Russia (which did the same in 1992 and 1995), and from the A.Q. Khan network. Iran ""began pursuing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle capability by developing a uranium mining infrastructure and experimenting with uranium conversion and enrichment."" According to the nonpartisan Nuclear Threat Initiative, ""U.S. intelligence agencies have long suspected Iran of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover for clandestine weapons development."" Iran, in contrast, ""has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful."" In August 2002, the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, an Iranian dissident group, publicly revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities, the Arak heavy-water production facility and the Natanz enrichment facility. In February 2003, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami acknowledged the existence of the facilities and asserted that Iran had undertaken ""small-scale enrichment experiments"" to produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. In late February, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors visited Natanz. In May 2003, Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Kalaye Electric Company, but refused to allow them to take samples, and an IAEA report the following month concluded that Iran had failed to meet its obligations under the previous agreement. In June 2003, Iran—faced with the prospect of being referred to the UN Security Council—entered into diplomatic negotiations with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the EU 3). The United States refused to be involved in these negotiations. In October 2003, the Tehran Declaration was reached between Iran and the EU 3; under this declaration Iran agreed to cooperate fully with the IAEA, sign the Additional Protocol, and temporarily suspend all uranium enrichment. In September and October 2003, the IAEA conducted several facility inspections. This was followed by the Paris Agreement in November 2004, in which Iran agreed to temporarily suspend enrichment and conversion activities, ""including the manufacture, installation, testing, and operation of centrifuges, and committed to working with the EU-3 to find a mutually beneficial long-term diplomatic solution."" In August 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner, was elected president of Iran. He accused Iranian negotiators who had negotiated the Paris Accords of treason. Over the next two months, the EU 3 agreement fell apart as talks over the EU 3's proposed Long Term Agreement broke down; the Iranian government ""felt that the proposal was heavy on demands, light on incentives, did not incorporate Iran's proposals, and violated the Paris Agreement."" Iran notified the IAEA that it would resume uranium conversion at Esfahan. In February 2006, Iran ended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and resumed enrichment at Natanz, prompting the IAEA Board of Governors to refer Iran to the UN Security Council. After the vote, Iran announced it would resume enrichment of uranium. In April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had nuclear technology, but stated that it was purely for power generation and not for producing weapons. In June 2006, the EU 3 joined China, Russia, and the United States, to form the P5+1. The following month, July 2006, the UN Security Council passed its first resolution demanding Iran stop uranium enrichment and processing. Altogether, from 2006 to 2010, the UN Security Council subsequently adopted six resolutions concerning Iran's nuclear program: 1696 (July 2006), 1737 (December 2006), 1747 (March 2007), 1803 (March 2008), 1835 (September 2008), and 1929 (June 2010). The legal authority for the IAEA Board of Governors referral and the Security Council resolutions was derived from the IAEA Statute and the United Nations Charter. The resolutions demanded that Iran cease enrichment activities and imposed sanctions on Iran, including bans on the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to the country and freezes on the assets of certain Iranian individuals and entities, in order to pressure the country. However, in Resolution 1803 and elsewhere the Security Council also acknowledged Iran's rights under Article IV of the NPT, which provides for ""the inalienable right ... to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful Purposes."" In July 2006, Iran opened the Arak heavy water production plant, which led to one of the Security Council resolutions. In September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, revealed the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near Qom saying that ""Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime."" Israel threatened to take military action against Iran. In a February 2007 interview with the Financial Times, IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei said that military action against Iran ""would be catastrophic, counterproductive"" and called for negotiations between the international community and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program. ElBaradei specifically proposed a ""double, simultaneous suspension, a time out"" as ""a confidence-building measure,"" under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment. ElBaradei also said that ""if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much more important issues to me than the suspension of ,"" naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from ""go to industrial capacity until the issues are settled""; building confidence, with ""full inspection"" involving Iranian adoption of the Additional Protocol; and ""at all costs"" preventing Iran from ""moving out of the  system."" A November 2007 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate assessed that Iran ""halted its nuclear weapons program"" in 2003; that estimate and subsequent U.S. Intelligence Community statements also assessed that the Iranian government at the time had was ""keeping open the 'option' to develop nuclear weapons"" in the future. A July 2015 Congressional Research Service report said that ""statements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon."" In March 2013, the United States began a series of secret bilateral talks with Iranian officials in Oman, led by William Joseph Burns and Jake Sullivan on the American side and Ali Asghar Khaji on the Iranian side. In June 2013, Hassan Rouhani was elected president of Iran. Rouhani has been described as ""more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad."" However, in a 2006 nuclear negotiation with European powers, Rouhani said that Iran had used the negotiations to dupe the Europeans, saying that during the negotiations, Iran managed to master the conversion of uranium yellowcake at Isfahan. The conversion of yellowcake is an important step in the nuclear fuel process. In August 2013, three days after his inauguration, Rouhani called for a resumption of serious negotiations with the P5+1 on the Iranian nuclear program. In September 2013, Obama and Rouhani had a telephone conversation, the first high-level contact between U.S. and Iranian leaders since 1979, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a meeting with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, signaling that the two countries had an opening to cooperation. After several rounds of negotiations, on 24 November 2013, the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. The IAEA began ""more intrusive and frequent inspections"" under this interim agreement. The agreement was formally activated on 20 January 2014. On that day, the IAEA issued a report stating that Iran was adhering to the terms of the interim agreement, including stopping enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, beginning the dilution process (to reduce half of the stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to 3.5 percent), and halting work on the Arak heavy-water reactor. A major focus on the negotiations was limitations on Iran's key nuclear facilities: the Arak IR-40 heavy water reactor and production plant (which was under construction, but never became operational, as Iran agreed as part of the November 2013 Joint Plan of Action (interim agreement) not to commission or fuel the reactor); the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant; the Gachin uranium mine; the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant; the Isfahan uranium-conversion plant; the Natanz uranium enrichment plant; and the Parchin military research and development complex. The agreement between the P5+1+EU and Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the culmination of 20 months of ""arduous"" negotiations. The agreement followed the Joint Plan of Action (JPA), an interim agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran that was agreed to on 24 November 2013 at Geneva. The Geneva agreement was an interim deal, in which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some sanctions. This went into effect on 20 January 2014. The parties agreed to extend their talks with a first extension deadline on 24 November 2014 and a second extension deadline set to 1 July 2015. An Iran nuclear deal framework was reached on 2 April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of international inspections under a framework deal. These details were to be negotiated by the end of June 2015. The negotiations toward a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were extended several times until the final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was finally reached on 14 July 2015. The JCPOA is based on the framework agreement from three months earlier. Subsequently the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 continued. In April 2014, a framework deal was reached at Lausanne. Intense marathon negotiations then continued, with the last session in Vienna at the Palais Coburg lasting for seventeen days. At several points, negotiations appeared to be at risk of breaking down, but negotiators managed to come to agreement. As the negotiators neared a deal, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry directly asked Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to confirm that he was ""authorized to actually make a deal, not just by the  president, but by the supreme leader?"" Zarif gave assurances that he was. Ultimately, on 14 July 2015, all parties agreed to a landmark comprehensive nuclear agreement. At the time of the announcement, shortly before 11:00 GMT, the agreement was released to the public. The final agreement's complexity shows the impact of a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others in June 2015, written when negotiations were still going on. That letter outlined concerns about the several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win their support for it. After the final agreement was reached, one of the signatories, Robert J. Einhorn, a former U.S. Department of State official now at the Brookings Institution, said of the agreement: ""Analysts will be pleasantly surprised. The more things are agreed to, the less opportunity there is for implementation difficulties later on."" The final agreement is based upon (and buttresses) ""the rules-based nonproliferation regime created by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and including especially the IAEA safeguards system."" The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) runs to 109 pages, including five annexes. Major provisions of the final accord include the following: As a result of the above, the ""breakout time""—the time in which it would be possible for Iran to make enough material for a single nuclear weapon—will increase from two to three months to one year, according to U.S. officials and U.S. intelligence. An August 2015 report published by a group of experts at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs concurs in these estimates, writing that under the JCPOA, ""over the next decade would be extended to roughly a year, from the current estimated breakout time of 2 to 3 months."" The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation also accepts these estimates. By contrast, Alan J. Kuperman, coordinator of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project at the University of Texas at Austin, disputed the one-year assessment, arguing that under the agreement, Iran's breakout time ""would be only about three months, not much longer than it is today."" The longer breakout time would be in place for at least ten years; after that point, the breakout time would gradually decrease. By the fifteenth year, U.S. officials state that the breakout time would return to the pre-JCPOA status quo of a few months. The Belfer Center report states: ""Some contributors to this report believe that breakout time by year 15 could be comparable to what it is today—a few months—while others believe it could be reduced to a few weeks."" Reuters reported that exemptions were granted to Iran prior to January 16, 2016. The reported purpose of the exemptions was so that sanctions relief and other benefits could start by that date, instead of Iran being in violation. The exemptions included: (a) Iran able to exceed the 300 Kg of 3.5% LEU limit in the agreement; (b) Iran able to exceed the zero Kg of 20% LEU limit in the agreement; (c) Iran to keep operating 19 ""hot cells"" that exceed the size limit in the agreement; (d) Iran to maintain control of 50 tonnes of heavy water that exceed the 130 tonne limit in the agreement by storing the excess at an Iran-controlled facility in Oman. In December 2016, the IAEA published decisions of the Joint Commission that spell out these clarifications of the JCPOA. The following provisions regarding sanctions are written into the JCPOA: Ankit Panda of The Diplomat states that this will make impossible any scenario where Iran is non-compliant with the JCPOA yet escapes re-imposition of sanctions. Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (which opposes the agreement) argues, however, that because the JCPOA provides that Iran could treat reinstatement of sanctions (in part or entirely) as grounds for leaving the agreement, the United States would be reluctant to impose a ""snapback"" for smaller violations: ""The only thing you'll take to the Security Council are massive Iranian violations, because you're certainly not going to risk the Iranians walking away from the deal and engaging in nuclear escalation over smaller violations."" According to several commentators, JCPOA is the first of its kind in the annals of non-proliferation and is in many aspects unique. The 159-page JCPOA document and its five appendices, is the most spacious text of a multinational treaty since World War II. Throughout the history of international law, this is the first and only time that a country subject to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter – Iran – has managed to end its case and stop being subject to this chapter through diplomacy. All other cases have ended through either regime change, war or full implementation of the Security Council's decisions by the country. This is the first time that the United Nations Security Council has recognized the nuclear enrichment program of a developing country –Iran– and backs an agreement (JCPOA) signed by several countries within the framework of a resolution (United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231). For the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country –Iran– was able to abolish 6 UN resolutions against it –1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, 1929– without even one day of implementating them. Sanctions against Iran was also lifted for the first time. In the 47-year history of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), no country other than Iran has ever voluntarily agreed to put extraordinary restrictions on its nuclear activities. During the final negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stayed in Vienna for 17 days, making him the top American official devoting time to a single international negotiation in more than four decades. Mohammad Javad Zarif broke the record of an Iranian Foreign Minister being far from home with 18-days stay in Vienna, and set the record of 106 days of negotiations in 687 days, a number higher than any other chief nuclear negotiator in 12 years. The negotiations became the longest continuous negotiations with the presence of all foreign ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations included 'rare events' in Iran–United States relations not only since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, but also in the history of the bilateral relations. The U.S. Secretary of State and Iranian Foreign Minister met on 18 different dates –sometimes multiple occasions a day– and in 11 different cities, unprecedented since the beginning of the relations. On 27 April 2015, John Kerry visited the official residence of the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations –which counts as Iranian soil– to meet his counterpart. The encounter was the first of its kind since the Iran hostage crisis. On the sidelines of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. President Barack Obama shook hands with the Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, marking the first such event in history. The event was also noted in form of diplomatic ranks, as a head of state shook hands with a minister. Obama is reported to have said in the meeting: ""Too much effort has been put into the JCPOA and we all should be diligent to implement it"". There was a significant worldwide response following the announcement of the agreement; more than 90 countries endorsed the agreement, as did many international organizations. Following the unveiling of the agreement, ""a general consensus quickly emerged"" among nuclear experts and watchdogs that the agreement ""is as close to a best-case situation as reality would allow."" In August 2015, 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts signed a statement endorsing the deal as ""a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts"" that exceeds the historical standards for arms control agreements. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists invited top international security experts to comment on the final agreement. American TV series Madam Secretary built a whole season around the negotiations. Five years before the deal, in 24's season 8, the negotiations between the United States leaders and ""President Hassan"" of Islamic republic of Kamistan to abandon his nuclear technology programme was shown, which drew comparison to the US-Iran dispute. However the deal was contrarily to Homeland's season 3 plot that ""fueled nuclear paranoia"" against Iran. After the deal, a joke began circulating in Iran that the name of city of Arak would change to “Barack” in honor of Obama, and that in return, the United States would change the name of Manhattan borough to “Mash Hassan” (Persian: مش حسن‎‎) which is a very casual way of referring to Rouhani. Javad Zarif's efforts in the negotiations drew comparisons to mythological Arash the Archer, and two former Prime Ministers: Mohammad Mosaddegh, who leaded withdrawal of foreigners and nationalization of the Iran oil industry and was overthrown by American–British coup d'état, because both fought foreigners for Iran’s rights; and Amir Kabir, because both faced domestic hostility through their way to gain more interest for the nation. Public polling on the issue has yielded varied and sometimes contradictory results, depending on the question wording, whether the poll explains the provisions of the agreement, and whether an ""undecided"" option is offered. Polls have consistently shown polarization by party affiliation, with majorities of self-identified Democrats supporting the agreement and majorities of self-identified Republicans opposing it. As provided for in the JCPOA, the agreement was formally endorsed by the UN Security Council, incorporating it into international law. There was initially disagreement on if the deal is legally binding on the United States. The U.S State Department clarified this in a 19 November 2015 letter to Congress, stating that ""The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA reflects political commitments between Iran, the P5+1, and the EU."" According to the State Department Political Commitments are non-binding. On 15 July 2015, the American ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, circulated a fourteen-page draft to Council members. On 20 July 2015, the Security Council unanimously approved the fourteen-page resolution—United Nations Security Council resolution 2231—in a 15–0 vote. The resolution delays its official implementation for 90 days, to allow for U.S. Congressional consideration under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. The resolution lays out the steps for terminating sanctions imposed by seven past Security Council resolutions, but retains an arms embargo and ballistic missile technology ban. The resolution also did not affect the sanctions imposed separately by the United States and the European Union. The resolution also codifies the ""snapback"" mechanism of the agreement, under which all Security Council sanctions will be automatically reimposed if Iran breaches the deal. Speaking immediately after the vote, Power told the Security Council that sanctions relief would start only when Iran ""verifiably"" met its obligations, and also called upon Iran ""to immediately release all unjustly detained Americans,"" specifically naming Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian, who are imprisoned in Iran, and Robert A. Levinson, who has been missing in the country. On the same day that the Security Council approved a resolution, the European Union formally approved the JCPOA via a vote of the EU Foreign Affairs Council (the group of EU foreign ministers) meeting in Brussels. This sets into motion the lifting of certain EU sanctions, including those prohibiting the purchase of Iranian oil. The EU continues its sanctions relating to human rights and its sanctions prohibiting the export of ballistic missile technology. The approval by the EU was seen as a signal to the U.S. Congress. Under U.S. law, the JCPOA is a non-binding political commitment. According to the U.S. State Department, it specifically is not an executive agreement or a treaty. There are widespread incorrect reports that it is an executive agreement. In contrast to treaties, which require two-thirds of the Senate to consent to ratification, political commitments require no congressional approval, and are not legally binding. Under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, which was signed into law on 22 May 2015, the agreement is undergoing a sixty-day review in the United States Congress. Under that Act, once all documents have been sent to the Capitol, Congress will have sixty days in which it can pass a resolution of approval, a resolution of disapproval, or do nothing. (The Act includes additional time beyond the sixty days for the president to veto a resolution and for Congress to take a vote on whether to override or sustain the veto.) President Obama has said he will veto any resolution of disapproval. Thus, Republicans will only be able to defeat the deal if they can muster the two-thirds of both houses of Congress needed to override a veto of any resolution of disapproval. This means that 34 votes in the Senate could sustain a veto and place the JCPOA into effect. On 19 July 2015, the State Department officially transmitted to Congress the JCPOA, its annexes, and related materials. These documents include the Unclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the Intelligence Community's Classified Annex to the Verification Assessment Report. The sixty-day review period began the next day, 20 July, and will end 17 September. On 30 July, Senator Ted Cruz introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that the sixty-day congressional review under the Act should not begin until the Senate obtains a copy of all bilateral Iran-IAEA documents. The ""international community"" has long sought a landmark diplomatic agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, and such an agreement was also a long-sought foreign-policy goal of the Obama administration. In comments made in the East Room of the White House on 15 July 2015, President Obama urged Congress to support the agreement, saying ""If we don't choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly, for letting this moment slip away."" Obama stated that the inspections regime in the agreement was among the most vigorous ever negotiated, and criticized opponents of the deal for failing to offer a viable alternative to it. Obama stated: ""If 99 percent of the world's community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say 'this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb,' and you are arguing either that it does not ... then you should have some alternative to present. And I haven't heard that."" The same day, Obama made a case for the deal on the agreement in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. Obama stated: Also on 15 July, Vice President Joe Biden met with Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he made a presentation on the agreement. On 18 July, Obama devoted his weekly radio address to the agreement, stating that ""this deal will make America and the world safer and more secure"" and rebutting ""a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it."" Obama stated ""as commander-in-chief, I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war."" On 23 July, President Obama met in the White House Cabinet Room with about a dozen undecided House Democrats to speak about the agreement and seek their support. The debate over the agreement has been marked by acrimony between the White House and with Republicans inside and outside of Congress. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said that under the agreement ""the Obama administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world."" Former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, called the president ""naive"" and repeatedly invoked the Holocaust, saying that the president's policy would ""take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven."" This comparison was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and various Israeli government officials. At a 27 June news conference, Obama specifically criticized Huckabee, Cruz, and Cotton, saying that such remarks were ""just part of a general pattern we've seen that would be considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad,"" especially from ""leaders in the Republican Party."" Obama stated that ""fling out ad hominem attacks like that ... doesn't help inform the American people"" and stated: ""This is a deal that has been endorsed by people like Brent Scowcroft and Sam Nunn ... historic Democratic and Republican leaders on arms control and on keeping America safe. And so when you get rhetoric like this, maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now."" On 5 August, Obama gave a speech before an audience of around 200 at American University, marking a new phase in the administration's campaign for the agreement. Obama stated: ""Let's not mince words: The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war—maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon. How can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?"" In his speech, Obama also invoked a speech made by John F. Kennedy at American University in 1963 in favor of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Obama also said that the opponents of the agreement were the same people who created the ""drumbeat of war"" that led to the Iraq War and criticized ""knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision made to be a disaster, a surrender."" New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, made a different assessment of prospects for war by distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear aspects of the agreement. In each case he asked whether we are better off with the agreement or without it and his conclusion was: ""… when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement within ten years, we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it."" Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, ""Who’s to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great."" And, finally, Schumer concluded: ""I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power."" In the same speech, Obama stated: ""Just because Iranian hard-liners chant 'Death to America' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hard-liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard-liners chanting 'Death to America' who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus."" This statement was criticized by congressional Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it ""crass political rhetoric"" that was a strategy to ""Demonize your opponents, gin up the base, get the Democrats all angry, and rally around the president."" McConnell said ""This is an enormous national security debate that the president will leave behind, under the Constitution, a year and a half from now, and the rest of us will be dealing with the consequences of it. So I wish he would tone down the rhetoric and let's talk about the facts"" and promised that Republicans would discuss the agreement respectfully in September. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, asserted that the president was ""trying to shut down debate by saying that those who have legitimate questions, legitimate questions — are somehow unpatriotic, are somehow compared to hardliners in Iran."" The president subsequently stood by his statement, with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling it a ""statement of fact"" and the president saying in an interview, ""Remember, what I said was that it's the hard-liners in Iran who are most opposed to this deal. And I said, in that sense, they're making common cause with those who are opposed to this deal here. I didn’t say that they were equivalent."" In the same interview, Obama said: ""A sizable proportion of the Republicans were opposed before the ink was even dry on the deal."" In comments made at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado in July 2015, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that the JCPOA will improve the U.S. ability to monitor Iran, saying "" puts us in a far better place in terms of insight and access"" than no agreement. While Clapper remains ""concerned about compliance and deceit,"" but ""pointed out that during the negotiation period  complied with rules"" negotiated under the interim agreement (the Joint Plan of Action). An intense public debate in the United States took place during the congressional review period. ""Some of the wealthiest and most powerful donors in American politics, those for and against the accord,"" became involved in the public debate, although ""mega-donors"" opposing the agreement have contributed substantially more money than those supporting it. From 2010 to early August 2015, the foundations of Sheldon Adelson, Paul Singer, and Haim Saban contributed a total of $13 million (at least $7.5 million, at least $2.6 million, and at least $2.9 million, respectively) to advocacy groups opposing an agreement with Iran. On the other side, three groups lobbying in support of the agreement have received at least $803,000 from the Ploughshares Fund, at least $425,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and at least $68,500 from George Soros and his foundation. Other philanthropists and donors supporting an agreement include S. Daniel Abraham, Tim Gill, Norman Lear, Margery Tabankin, and Arnold Hiatt. Many Iranian Americans, even those who fled repression in Iran and oppose its government, welcomed the JCPOA as a step forward. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC), Iranian American Bar Association, and other Iranian American organizations welcomed the JCPOA. The NIAC released a statement saying: ""Our negotiators have done their job to win a strong nuclear deal that prevents an Iranian nuclear weapon, all the while avoiding a catastrophic war. Now is the time for Congress to do theirs. Make no mistake: if Congress rejects this good deal with Iran, there will be no better deal forthcoming and Congress will be left owning an unnecessary war."" NIAC created a new group, NIAC Action, to run advertisements supporting the agreement. NIAC also organized an open letter from 73 Middle East and foreign affairs scholars stating that ""reactivating diplomatic channels between the United States and Iran is a necessary first step"" to reduce conflict in the region, and that while ""the nuclear deal will not automatically or immediately bring stability to the region ... Ultimately, a Middle East where diplomacy is the norm rather than the exception will enhance U.S. national security and interests,"" Signatories to the letter include John Esposito, Ehsan Yarshater, Noam Chomsky, Peter Beinart, John Mearsheimer, and Stephen Walt. U.S. pro-Israel groups divided on the JCPOA. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee opposes the agreement, and formed a new 501(c)(4) group, Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, to run a television advertising campaign against the JCPOA. In August 2015, it was reported that AIPAC and Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran plan to spend between $20 million and $40 million on its campaign. From mid-July to 4 August 2015, AIPAC's Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran spent more than $11 million running network television political advertisements opposing the agreement in 23 states, spending more than $1 million in the large states of California, Florida, New York, and Texas. In the first week of August, AIPAC said that it had 400 meetings with congressional offices as part of its campaign to defeat the agreement. In contrast to AIPAC, another pro-Israel organization, J Street, supports the agreement, and plans a $5 million advertising effort of its own to encourage Congress to support the agreement. During the first week of August, J Street launched a $2 million, three-week ad campaign in support of the agreement, with television ads running in Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. From mid-July through early August, J Street reported having 125 meetings with congressional offices. J Street has also paid to fly prominent Israelis who support the agreement (including Amram Mitzna, a retired Israeli general, member of the Knesset, and mayor of Haifa) to the United States to help persuade members of Congress to support the agreement. The group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) opposes the agreement and committed to spending more than $20 million on a national ""TV, radio, print and digital campaign"" against the agreement. After UANI announced its opposition, the group's president and co-founder, nonproliferation expert Gary Samore, announced that he had concluded ""that the accord was in the United States' interest"" and supported the agreement. Samore thus stepped down as president and was replaced by ex-Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. By 20 August, UANI had released its third national television ad against the agreement. Various other groups that have also run ad campaigns for or against the agreement. John R. Bolton's Foundation for American Security and Freedom has run advertisements against the agreement, as has ""Veterans Against the Deal,"" a group which does not disclose its donors. Various pro-agreement ads were run by MoveOn.org (which ran an ad with the title ""Let Diplomacy Work"" theme), Americans United for Change (which warned ""They're back – the Iraq war hawks are fighting the Iran deal, want more war"" over photos of Bolton, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld), and Global Zero (which ran a humorous ad featuring actors Jack Black, Morgan Freeman, and Natasha Lyonne). The New York-based Iran Project, a nonprofit led by former high-level U.S. diplomats and funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, along with the United Nations Association of the United States, supports the agreement. The Rockefeller fund has also supported the San Francisco-based Ploughshares Fund, which has spent several years marshaling support for an agreement. On 17 July 2015, a bipartisan open letter endorsing the Iran agreement was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials. The ex-ambassadors wrote: ""If properly implemented, this comprehensive and rigorously negotiated agreement can be an effective instrument in arresting Iran’s nuclear program and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in the volatile and vitally important region of the Middle East. In our judgment the  deserves Congressional support and the opportunity to show it can work. We firmly believe that the most effective way to protect U.S. national security, and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more costly and risky alternatives."" Among the signatories to the letter were Daniel C. Kurtzer, James Robert Jones, Frank E. Loy, Princeton N. Lyman, Jack F. Matlock, Jr., Donald F. McHenry, Thomas E. McNamara, and Thomas R. Pickering. A separate public letter to Congress in support of the agreement from five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from administrations of both parties, and three former Under Secretaries of State was released on 26 July 2015. This letter was signed by R. Nicholas Burns, James B. Cunningham, William C. Harrop, Daniel Kurtzer, Thomas R. Pickering, Edward S. Walker, Jr., and Frank G. Wisner. The former officials wrote: ""We are persuaded that this agreement will put in place a set of constraints and monitoring measures that will arrest Iran’s nuclear program for at least fifteen years and assure that this agreement will leave Iran no legitimate avenue to produce a nuclear weapon during the next ten to fifteen years. This landmark agreement removes the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and to Israel specifically."" Another public letter to Congress urging approval of the agreement was signed by a bipartisan group of more than sixty ""national-security leaders,"" including politicians, retired military officers, and diplomats. This letter, dated 20 July 2015, stated: ""We congratulate President Obama and all the negotiators for a landmark agreement unprecedented in its importance for preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran...We have followed carefully the negotiations as they have progressed and conclude that the JCPOA represents the achievement of greater security for us and our partners in the region."" Among the Republicans who signed this letter are former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, and former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. Among the Democrats who signed the letter are former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; former Senate Majority Leaders George J. Mitchell and Tom Daschle, former Senator Carl Levin, and former Defense Secretary William Perry. Also signing were former National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft; Under Secretaries of State R. Nicholas Burns and Thomas R. Pickering; U.S. Ambassadors Ryan Crocker and Stuart Eizenstat; Admiral Eric T. Olson; Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy; and Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn. On 8 August 2015, 29 prominent U.S. scientists, mostly physicists, published an open letter endorsing the agreement. The letter, addressed to President Obama, says: ""We congratulate you and your team on negotiating a technically sound, stringent and innovative deal that will provide the necessary assurance in the coming decade and more than Iran is not developing nuclear weapons, and provides a basis for further initiatives to raise the barriers to nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and around the globe."" The letter also states that the agreement ""will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements."" The 29 signatories included ""some of the world's most knowledgeable experts in the fields of nuclear weapons and arms control,"" many of whom have held Q clearances and have been longtime advisers to Congress, the White House, and federal agencies. The five primary authors were Richard L. Garwin (a nuclear physicist who played a key role in the development of the first hydrogen bomb and who was described by the New York Times as ""among the last living physicists who helped usher in the nuclear age""); Robert J. Goldston (Director of the Princeton Program on Science and Global Security and former director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory); R. Scott Kemp (an MIT professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering and a former science advisor for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department); Rush D. Holt (a physicist and former U.S. Representative who is now the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science); and Frank N. von Hippel (Princeton Professor of Public Policy and former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy). Six Nobel Prize in Physics laureates co-signed the letter: Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University; Leon N. Cooper of Brown University; Sheldon L. Glashow of Boston University; David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Burton Richter of Stanford University; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among the other scientists to sign are Siegfried S. Hecker (a Stanford physicist and the former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory); Freeman Dyson (of Princeton), and Sidney Drell (of Stanford). On 11 August 2015, an open letter endorsing the agreement signed by 36 retired military generals and admirals, entitled ""The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security: An Open Letter from Retired Generals and Admirals,"" was released. The letter, signed by retired officers from all five branches of the U.S. armed services, said that the agreement was ""the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons,"" and said that ""If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military action against Iran, gathering sufficient international support for such an effort would only be possible if we have first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust diplomatic options before moving to military ones."" The signers included General James E. ""Hoss"" Cartwright of the Marine Corps, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Joseph P. Hoar of the Marine Corps, the former commander of the U.S. Central Command; and Generals Merrill McPeak and Lloyd W. Newton of the Air Force. Other signers include Lieutenant Generals Robert G. Gard, Jr. and Claudia J. Kennedy; Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn; Rear Admirals Garland Wright and Joseph Sestak; and Major General Paul D. Eaton. The above letter was answered on 25 August 2015, by a letter signed by more than 200 retired generals and admirals opposing the deal. The letter asserted: ""The agreement does not 'cut off every pathway' for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. To the contrary, it provides Iran with a legitimate pathway for doing exactly that simply by abiding by the deal. ...the JCPOA would threaten the national security and vital interests of the United States and, therefore, should be disapproved by the Congress."" This letter was organized by Leon A. ""Bud"" Edney; other signers included Admiral James A. Lyons; Lieutenant General William G. Boykin, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney, former vice commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe. Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni said that he had refused requests from both sides to sign their letters, saying to Time magazine: ""I'm convinced that 90% of the guys who signed the letter one way or the other don't have any clue about whether it's a good or bad deal. They sign it because somebody’s asked them to sign it."" As to the JCPOA Zinni said: ""The agreement’s fine, if you think it can work. But if this is a Neville Chamberlain then you’re in a world of shit."" On 13 August, retired Senators Carl Levin of Michigan, a Democrat, and John Warner of Virginia, a Republican, co-wrote an op-ed in support of the agreement—entitled ""Why hawks should also back the Iran deal""—published in Politico. Levin and Warner, both past chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued that ""If we reject the agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop Iran"" in the event that military action was needed in the future. Levin and Warner wrote that ""The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of a coalition that participates in and could support the use of a military option. The failure of the United States to join the agreement would have that effect."" On 14 August, retired senators Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican, and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a Democrat, also wrote in support of the agreement. In a column for Reuters, Lugar and Johnston argued that ""Rejection of the agreement would severely undermine the U.S. role as a leader and reliable partner around the globe. If Washington walks away from this hard-fought multilateral agreement, its dependability would likely be doubted for decades."" They also wrote: ""Tehran would be the winner of this U.S. rejection because it would achieve its major objective: the lifting of most sanctions without being required to accept constraints on its nuclear program. Iran could also claim to be a victim of American perfidy and try to convince other nations to break with U.S. leadership and with the entire international sanctions regime."" On 17 August 2015, a group of 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts issued a joint statement endorsing the agreement. The statement says that ""the JCPOA is a strong, long-term, and verifiable agreement that will be a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts"" and that the JCPOA's ""rigorous limits and transparency measures will make it very likely that any future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly, providing the opportunity to intervene decisively to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon."" The letter was organized through the nonpartisan Arms Control Association. Among the 75 signatories are the Valerie Plame and Joseph C. Wilson; former IAEA director-general Hans Blix; Morton H. Halperin; and experts from the Brookings Institution, Stimson Center, and other think tanks. On 3 September, an open letter to President Obama signed by 56 people was issued criticizing the JCPOA as ""unverifiable."" The letter said: ""Guided by our experience with U.S. and foreign nuclear weapons programs – as well as with the history and practice of arms control, nonproliferation, and intelligence matters, we judge the current JCPOA to be a very bad deal indeed."" Signers included Boykin; Bolton; ex-CIA director James Woolsey, former national security advisor Robert McFarlane; Paula A. DeSutter, former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; various former ACDA officials; and former Sandia National Laboratories president/director C. Paul Robinson. Foreign diplomats are also involved in the congressional debate. The Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer appeared on cable television shows to attack the agreement, while ambassadors from European nations, including Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the United States, ""came on to say the precise opposite."" Dermer also lobbied members of Congress on Capitol Hill against the agreement, while diplomats from France, Britain, and Germany made the rounds on Capitol Hill to advocate for the agreement. On 4 August, P5+1 diplomats held ""a rare meeting of world powers' envoys on Capitol Hill"" with about 30 Senate Democrats to urge support for the agreement, saying that ""If Congress rejects this good deal, and the U.S. is forced to walk away, Iran will be left with an unconstrained nuclear program with far weaker monitoring arrangements, the current international consensus on sanctions would unravel, and international unity and pressure on Iran would be seriously undermined."" On Meet the Press on 6 September 2014, former Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed support for the nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that it was ""a pretty good deal."" Powell said that various provisions accepted by Iran—such as the reduction in centrifuges and the uranium stockpile and the agreement to shut down its plutonium reactor—were ""remarkable changes"" that stopped the Iranian pathway to a nuclear weapons program. Powell also defended the verification provisions of the agreement, saying: ""I think a very vigorous verification regime has been put into place."" Former Ambassador Dennis Ross, a longtime American negotiator in the Middle East, wrote that he was not yet convinced by either proponents or opponents of the agreement. Ross wrote that the United States should be focused on ""deterring the Iranians from cheating"" (e.g., by producing highly enriched uranium) after year fifteen of the agreement. Ross wrote that ""President Obama emphasizes that the agreement is based on verification not trust. But our catching Iran cheating is less important than the price they know they will pay if we catch them. Deterrence needs to apply not just for the life of the deal."" As part of a deterrence strategy, Ross proposed transferring to Israel the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) ""bunker buster"" bomb at some point before year fifteen of the agreement. In a 25 August op-ed in the Washington Post, Ross and David H. Petraeus again argued for transferring the MOP to Israel. The Jewish American community was divided on the agreement. On 19 August 2015, leaders of the Reform Jewish movement, the largest Jewish denomination in the United States, issued a lengthy public statement expressed a neutral position on the agreement. The statement, signed by the leaders of the Union for Reform Judaism, Central Conference of American Rabbis, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and Association of Reform Zionists of America, reflected what Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the URJ, called ""deep divisions within the movement."" On 20 August 2015, a group of 26 prominent current and foreign American Jewish communal leaders published a full-page ad in the New York Times with a statement backing the agreement; signers included three former chairs of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations as well as former AIPAC executive director Tom Dine. Separately, a group of 340 rabbis organized by Ameinu issued a public letter to Congress on 17 August 2015, in support of the agreement, saying: ""We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord."" The signers were mostly Reform rabbis, but included at least 50 rabbis from the Conservative movement and at least one Orthodox rabbi. Prominent rabbis who signed this letter included Sharon Brous, Burton Visotzky, Nina Beth Cardin, Lawrence Kushner, Sharon Kleinbaum, and Amy Eilberg. In a separate letter released 27 August, eleven Democratic Jewish former members of Congress urged support for the agreement; the letter noted the signatories' pro-Israel credentials and said that the agreement ""halts the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran,"" while a rejection of the deal would ""put Iran back on the path to develop a nuclear weapon within two to three months."" Signatories included former Senator Carl Levin and former Representatives Barney Frank, Mel Levine, Steve Rothman, and Robert Wexler. Conversely, a group of 900 rabbis signed an open letter written by Kalman Topp and Yonah Bookstein in late August, calling upon Congress to reject the agreement. The Orthodox Union and American Jewish Committee also announced opposition to the agreement. The Roman Catholic Church has expressed support for the agreement. In a 14 July 2015 letter to Congress, Bishop Oscar Cantú, chairman of the Committee on International Justice and Peace of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, stated that the JCPOA was ""a momentous agreement"" which ""signals progress in global nuclear non-proliferation."" Cantú wrote that Catholic bishops in the United States ""will continue to urge Congress to endorse the result of these intense negotiations because the alternative leads toward armed conflict, an outcome of profound concern to the Church."" On 25 August 2015, a group of 53 Christian faith leaders from a variety of denominations sent a message to Congress urging them to support the agreement. The Christian leaders wrote: ""This is a moment to remember the wisdom of Jesus who proclaimed from the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God' (Matthew 5:9). ... There is no question we are all better off with this deal than without it."" The letter was coordinated by a Quaker group, the Friends Committee on National Legislation. Signatories to the letter included Jim Wallis of Sojourners; John C. Dorhauer, general minister and president of the United Church of Christ; Shane Claiborne; Adam Estle of Evangelicals for Middle East Understanding; Archbishop Vicken Aykazian of the Armenian Orthodox Church; A. Roy Medley, the head of American Baptist Churches USA; the Reverend Paula Clayton Dempsey of the Alliance of Baptists, senior pastor Joel C. Hunter of Northland, A Church Distributed; and Sister Simone Campbell, a leader of the Catholic ""Nuns on the Bus"" campaigns. A hearing on the JCPOA before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took place on 23 July 2015. Secretary of State Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and Energy Secretary Moniz testified. Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee chairman, said in his opening statement that when the talks began the goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program, whereas the achieved agreement codified ""the industrialization of their nuclear program."" Corker, addressing Secretary of State Kerry, said, ""I believe you've been fleeced"" and ""...what you've really done here is you have turned Iran from being a pariah to now Congress, Congress being a pariah."" Corker asserted that a new threshold in U.S. foreign policy was crossed and the agreement would ""enable a state sponsor of terror to obtain sophisticated, industrial nuclear development program that has, as we know, only one real practical need."" The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, said he had many questions and his hope was that the answers will cause a debate ""in Congress and the American people."" Democrats, led by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, expressed support for the agreement, with Boxer saying that criticisms by Republicans were ""ridiculous,"" ""unfair,"" and ""wrong."" Corker and Cardin sent a letter to Obama saying the bilateral IAEA-Iran document should be available for Congress to review. At the hearing Kerry, Lew, and Moniz ""were unequivocal in their statements that the accord was the best that could be achieved and that without it, the international sanctions regime would collapse."" Kerry warned that if the United States would be ""on our own"" if it were to walk away from a multi-lateral agreement alongside the five global powers. Kerry stated that the belief that ""some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation"" could be achieved was ""a fantasy, plain and simple."" The Washington Post reported that ""Moniz emerged as the calm center of the proceedings, beginning his interjections with recitations of what he described as 'facts,' and mildly observing that Republican characterizations were 'incorrect.'"" Kerry, Lew, and Moniz faced ""uniform animus of Republicans"" at the hearing, with Republican senators giving ""long and often scathing speeches denouncing what they described as a fatally flawed agreement and accusing the administration of dangerous naivete"" and showing ""little interest in responses"" from the three cabinet secretaries. Washington Post reported on twelve issues related to the agreement over which the two sides disagreed at the hearing. On 28 July, Kerry, Moniz, and Lew testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Committee chairman Ed Royce, Republican of California, said in his opening statement that ""we are being asked to consider an agreement that gives Iran permanent sanctions relief for temporary nuclear restrictions."" ""Royce also said the inspection regime 'came up short' from 'anywhere, anytime' access to Iran's nuclear facilities and criticized the removal of restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program and conventional arms."" The committee's ranking member, Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, said he has ""serious questions and concerns"" about the agreement. Kerry, Lew, and Moniz spent four hours testifying before the committee. At the hearing, Kerry stated that if Congress killed the deal, ""You'll not only be giving Iran a free pass to double the pace of its uranium enrichment, to build a heavy-water reactor, to install new and more efficient centrifuges, but they will do it all without the unprecedented inspection and transparency measures that we have secured. Everything that we have tried to prevent will now happen."" On 29 July, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kerry, Moniz, and Lew appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in a three-hour hearing. Carter and Dempsey had been invited to testify by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the committee; Kerry, Moniz, and Lew attended the hearing at the invitation of the Pentagon. In his opening statement, McCain said that if this agreement failed and U.S. armed forces were called to take action against Iran, they ""could be at greater risk because of this agreement."" He also asserted that the agreement may lead American allies and partners to fateful decisions and result in ""growing regional security competition, new arms races, nuclear proliferation, and possibly conflict."" The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said Congress had an obligation ""to independently validate that the agreement will meet our common goal of stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon"" and stated that ""the agreement, no matter your position on it, is historic and, if implemented scrupulously, could serve as a strategic inflection point in the world's relations with Iran, for international non-proliferation efforts, and for the political and security dynamics in the Middle East."" Carter said the agreement prevented Iran from ""getting a nuclear weapon in a comprehensive and verifiable way."" He assured the committee that the deal would not limit the U.S. ability to respond with military force if needed. In response to a question from McCain, Carter said he had ""no reason to foresee"" that the agreement would cause Iran's threatening behavior to change more broadly, stating ""That is why it's important that Iran not have a nuclear weapon."" Dempsey offered what he described as a ""pragmatic"" view. He neither praised nor criticized the deal, but did testify that the agreement reduced the chances of a near-term military conflict between the United States and Iran. Dempsey said that the agreement works to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but does not address other concerns about Iran's malign activities in the region, ranging from ""ballistic missile technology to weapons trafficking, to ... malicious activity in cyberspace."" Dempsey testified that ""Ultimately, time and Iranian behavior will determine if the nuclear agreement is effective and sustainable"" and stated that he would continue to provide military options to the president. Senator Joni Ernst expressed disagreement with President Obama who stated that the choice was the Iran nuclear deal or war. When General Martin Dempsey testified that the United States had ""a range of options"" and he presented them to the president, Ernst said: ""it's imperative everybody on the panel understand that there are other options available."" Under the JCPOA, Iran must submit a full report on its nuclear history before it can receive any sanctions relief. The IAEA has confidential technical arrangements with many countries as a matter of standard operating procedure. ""Republican lawmakers refer to these agreements as 'secret side deals' and claim that the JCPOA hinges on a set of agreements no one in the administration has actually seen."" Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican opponent of the agreement, said that Kerry had ""acted like Pontius Pilate and ""washed his hands, kicked it to the IAEA, knowing Congress would not get this information unless someone went out to find it."" On July 30, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that ""The 60-calendar day period for review of such agreement in the Senate cannot be considered to have begun until the Majority Leader certifies that all of the materials required to be transmitted under the definition of the term 'agreement' under such Act, including any side agreements with Iran and United States Government-issued guidance materials in relation to Iran, have been transmitted to the Majority Leader."" On 5 August, Yukiya Amano, director general of the IAEA, spoke with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a closed briefing about two IAEA documents: an agreement on inspection protocols with Iran and an agreement with Iran regarding Iranian disclosure of its previous nuclear activity (known as Possible Military Dimensions). Following this briefing with Amano, Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee chairman, told reporters: ""The majority of members here left with far more questions than they had before the meeting took place"" and ""We can not get him to even confirm that we will have physical access inside of Parchin."" The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Benjamin Cardin told reporters: ""I thought today was helpful, but it was not a substitute for seeing the document."" State Department spokesman John Kirby responded that ""There's no secret deals between Iran and the IAEA that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail"" and stated ""These kinds of technical arrangements with the IAEA are a matter of standard practice, that they're not released publicly or to other states, but our experts are familiar and comfortable with the contents, which we would be happy to discuss with Congress in a classified setting."" The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation writes that: ""The arrangement specifies procedural information regarding how the IAEA will conduct its investigation into Iran's past nuclear history, including mentioning the names of informants who will be interviewed. Releasing this information would place those informants, and the information they hold, at risk."" Mark Hibbs of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Thomas Shea, a former IAEA safeguards official and former head of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, wrote that the charges of a ""secret side deal"" made by opponents of the agreement were a ""manufactured controversy."" Hibbs and Shea noted: ""The IAEA has safeguards agreement with 180 countries. All have similar information protection provisions. Without these, governments would not open their nuclear programs for multilateral oversight. So IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano was acting by the book on August 5 when he told members of Congress that he couldn't share with them the details of  verification protocol the IAEA had negotiated with Iran as part of a bilateral 'roadmap.'"" David Albright, founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former IAEA nuclear inspector, stated that the demands for greater transparency regarding the agreement between Iran and IAEA ""aren't unreasonable"" and that ""Iran is a big screamer for more confidentiality. Nonetheless, if the IAEA wanted to make it more open, it could."" Albright also proposed that the United States ""should clearly and publicly confirm, and Congress should support with legislation, that if Iran does not address the IAEA’s concerns about the past military dimensions of its nuclear programs, U.S. sanctions will not be lifted."" Republican leaders vowed to attempt to kill the agreement as soon as it was released, even before classified sections were made available to Congress, and ""Republican lawmakers raced to send out news releases criticizing it."" According to the Washington Post, ""most congressional Republicans remained deeply skeptical, some openly scornful, of the prospect of relieving economic sanctions while leaving any Iranian uranium-enrichment capability intact."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the deal ""appears to fall well short of the goal we all thought was trying to be achieved, which was that Iran would not be a nuclear state."" A New York Times news analysis stated that Republican opposition to the agreement ""seems born of genuine distaste for the deal's details, inherent distrust of President Obama, intense loyalty to Israel and an expansive view of the role that sanctions have played beyond preventing Iran's nuclear abilities."" The Washington Post identified twelve issues related to the agreement on which the two sides disagreed, including the efficacy of inspections at undeclared sites; the effectiveness of the snapback sanctions; the significance of limits on enrichment; the significance of IAEA side agreements; the effectiveness of inspections of military sites; the consequences of walking away from an agreement; and the effects of lifting sanctions. One area of disagreement between supporters and opponents of the JCPOA is the consequences of walking away from an agreement, and whether renegotiation of the agreement is a realistic option. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, an opponent of the agreement, called for the U.S. government to keep sanctions in place, strengthen them, and ""pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be."" Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said that he believed that it was ""hyperbole"" to say that the agreement was the only alternative to war. President Obama, by contrast, argued that renegotiation of the deal is unrealistic, stating in his American University speech that ""the notion that there is a better deal to be had. ... relies on vague promises of toughness"" and stated that ""Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they are not being straight with the American people. ... Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty."" Obama also argued that ""those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position, as some have suggested, Congress' rejection would almost certainly result in multi-lateral sanctions unraveling,"" because ""our closest allies in Europe or in Asia, much less China or Russia, certainly are not going to enforce existing sanctions for another five, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power."" Secretary of State Kerry has echoed these remarks, saying in July 2015 that the idea of a ""'better deal,' some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation .... is a fantasy, plain and simple, and our intelligence community will tell you that."" Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, a supporter of the agreement wrote: ""Some say that, should the Senate reject this agreement, we would be in position to negotiate a ""better"" one. But I've spoken to representatives of the five nations that helped broker the deal, and they agree that this simply wouldn't be the case."" On 28 July 2015, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the longest-serving Jewish member now in Congress, announced in a lengthy statement that he would support the JCPOA, saying that ""the agreement is the best way"" to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that a rejection of the agreement would lead the international sanctions regime to ""quickly fall apart,"" as ""sanctions likely would not be continued even by our closest allies, and the United States would be isolated trying to enforce our unilateral sanctions as to Iran's banking and oil sectors."" A key figure in the congressional review process is Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin took a phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu opposing the agreement and participated in a private 90-minute session with Energy Secretary Moniz supporting the agreement. On 21 July, Cardin said that if the agreement is implemented, the United States should increase military aid to Israel and friendly Gulf states. On 4 August 2015, three key and closely watched Senate Democrats—Tim Kaine of Virginia (a Foreign Relations Committee member), Barbara Boxer of California (also a Foreign Relations Committee member), and Bill Nelson of Florida—announced their support for the agreement. In a floor speech that day, Kaine said that the agreement is ""far preferable to any other alternative, including war"" and that ""America has honored its best traditions and shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation and hostility cannot."" In a similar floor speech the same day, Nelson said that: ""I am convinced  will stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years. No other available alternative accomplishes this vital objective"" and ""If the U.S. walks away from this multinational agreement, I believe we would find ourselves alone in the world with little credibility."" Conversely, another closely watched senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, who is expected to make a bid to become Senate Democratic leader, announced his opposition to the agreement on 6 August, writing that ""there is a strong case that we are better off without an agreement than with one"" According to an Associated Press report, the classified assessment of the United States Intelligence Community on the agreement concludes that because Iran will be required by the agreement to provide international inspectors with ""unprecedented volume of information about nearly every aspect of its existing nuclear program,"" Iran's ability to conceal a covert weapons program will be diminished. In a 13 August letter to colleagues, ten current and former Democratic members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence (including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff) referred to this assessment as a reason to support the agreement, writing that ""We are confident that this monitoring and the highly intrusive inspections provided for in the agreement – along with our own intelligence capabilities – make it nearly impossible for Iran to develop a covert enrichment effort without detection."" The ten members also wrote ""You need not take our word for it"" and referred members to the classified assessment itself, which is located in an office in the Capitol basement and is available for members of Congress to read. A resolution of disapproval was initially expected to pass both the House and Senate, meaning that ""the real challenge for the White House is whether they can marshal enough Democrats to sustain the veto."" Two-thirds of both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are required to override a veto, meaning that one-third of either house (146 votes in the House, or 34 in the Senate) could sustain (uphold) President Obama's veto of a resolution of disapproval. By early September 2015, 34 Senators had publicly confirmed support for the deal, a crucial threshold because it ensured that the Senate could sustain (i.e., uphold) any veto of a resolution of disapproval. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland announced support on 2 September, a day after Chris Coons of Delaware and Bob Casey, Jr. of Pennsylvania also announced support, reaching 34 votes and assuring that an eventual disapproval resolution passed in the Senate could not override an Obama veto. By the following day, 38 Democratic senators supported the deal, 3 were opposed, and 5 were still undecided. By 8 September, all senators had made a commitment on the agreement, with 42 in support (40 Democrats and two independents) and 58 opposed (54 Republicans and four Democrats). It is possible for senators in support of the agreement to kill the disapproval resolution outright in the Senate by effectively filibustering it, making it unnecessary for Obama to veto a disapproval resolution at all. However, this is only possible if at least 41 vote to do so, and several senators in support of the agreement, including Coons, ""have suggested they'd prefer an up-or-down vote on the deal instead of blocking it altogether."" The apparent success of a strategy to marshal congressional support for the deal, linked to a carefully orchestrated rollout of endorsements (although Democratic Senate Whip Dick Durbin and other officials disputed the suggestion of coordination) was attributed to lessons learned by the White House and congressional Democrats during struggles in previous summers with Republicans, in particular, over Obama's health care legislation. An August 2015 meeting at which top diplomats from the UK, Russia, China, Germany, and France told 10 undecided Democratic senators they had no intention of returning to the negotiating table was reported to be particularly crucial. Senator Coons said: ""They were clear and strong that we will not join you in re-imposing sanctions."" On 20 August 2015, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that House Democrats had the votes to uphold a veto of a resolution of disapproval. To sustain a veto, Pelosi would need to hold only 146 of the 188 House Democrats; by 20 August, about 60 House Democrats have publicly declared their support for the final agreement, and about 12 had publicly declared their opposition. In May 2015, before the final agreement was announced, 151 House Democrats signed in support for the broad outlines in the April framework agreement; none of those signatories have announced opposition to the final agreement. It was originally expected that the House would vote on a formal resolution of disapproval introduced by Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. As the Senate moved toward a vote on a resolution of disapproval, House leadership (under Republican control) planned to vote on a similar resolution of disapproval. However, conservative Republicans ""revolted in protest"" as ""the chamber's right flank wanted tougher action from its leader"" and the House Republican leadership (under Speaker John Boehner) planned to vote instead chose to bring a resolution of approval to the floor ""as a way to effectively force Democrats who had voiced support for the president to formally register such endorsement."" On 11 September 2015, the resolution failed, as expected, on a 162-269 vote; 244 Republicans and 25 Democrats voted no, while 162 Democrats and no Republicans voted yes. On the same day, House Republicans held two additional votes, one on a resolution claiming that the Obama administration had failed to meet the requirements of a congressional review period on the deal and another resolution which would prevent the United States from lifting any sanctions. The former resolution passed on a party-line vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed; the latter resolution passed on nearly a party-line vote, with all Republicans and two Democrats in favor and every other Democrat opposed. The House action against the resolution was a ""symbolic vote that will have no consequence for the implementation of the deal,"" and the two anti-agreement measures passed by the House were seen as ""unlikely to even reach Obama's desk."" On 10 September, the day before the vote, House speaker Boehner threatened to ""use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented"" and said that a lawsuit by House Republicans against the president (claiming that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was not followed) was ""an option that is very possible."" Four months later, however, House Republicans abandoned their plans for a lawsuit against the administration over the JCPOA. Conservative legal activist Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit against President Obama and members of Congress in July 2015 in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, asserting that the agreement should be considered a treaty requiring Senate ratification. Klayman's suit was dismissed for lack of standing in September 2015. On 21 June 2015, the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) decided to form a committee to study the JCPOA and to wait at least 80 days before voting on it. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chief Ali Akbar Salehi, defended the deal in Parliament on the same day. Although the Iranian constitution gives Parliament the right to cancel the deal, it was reported that this outcome is unlikely. The New York Times reported that ""the legislators have effectively opted to withhold their judgment until they know whether the American Congress approves of the deal."" In televised remarks made on 23 July 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani rejected domestic criticism of the JCPOA from Iranian hardliners, ""such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its allies,"" which ""have criticized the accord as an invasive affront to the country's sovereignty and a capitulation to foreign adversaries, particularly the United States."" In remarks described by the New York Times as ""blunt"" and uncharacteristically frank, Rouhani claimed a popular mandate to make an agreement based on his election in 2013 and warned that the alternative was ""an economic Stone Age"" brought on by sanctions which (as the Times described) have ""shriveled oil exports and denied the country access to the global banking system."" On 26 July, a two-page, top-secret directive sent to Iranian newspaper editors from Iran's Supreme National Security Council surfaced online. In the document, newspapers are instructed to avoid criticism of the agreement and to avoid giving the impression of ""a rift"" at the highest levels of government. The BBC reported that the document appears to be aimed at constraining criticism of the JCPOA by Iranian hardliners. On 3 September, Iranian supreme leader Khamenei said that the Majlis should make the final decision on the agreement. On the same day, Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said that he support the agreement and that: ""The agreement needs to be discussed and needs to be approved by the Iranian parliament. There will be heated discussions and debates."" Abbas Milani and Michael McFaul write that: ""those  supporting the deal include moderates inside the government, many opposition leaders, a majority of Iranian citizens, and many in the Iranian American diaspora—a disparate group that has rarely agreed on anything until now."" Within the government, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the agreement, ""are now the most vocal in defending it against Iranian hawks."" Also vocally supporting the agreement are former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami and moderates within parliament. The agreement is also supported by most prominent opposition leaders, including Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a 2009 presidential candidate who is under house arrest for his role as a leader of the Green Movement. Conversely, ""the most militantly authoritarian, conservative, and anti-Western leaders and groups within Iran oppose the deal."" The anti-agreement coalition in Iran includes former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Fereydoon Abbasi, ex-nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili; and various conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guard commanders. This group has ""issued blistering attacks on the incompetence of Iran's negotiating team, claiming that negotiators caved on many key issues and were outmaneuvered by more clever and sinister American diplomats."" Iranian defense minister Hossein Dehqan said on 2 September that Iran would not allow the IAEA to visit every site or facility that it wishes. The Majlis special commission for examining the JCPOA, has invited Ali Shamkhani, as well as members of former nuclear negotiation team including Ali Bagheri and Fereydoon Abbasi to comment on the deal. During the session, Saeed Jalili, ex-chief negotiator has slammed the deal, stating ""approximately 100 absolute rights"" of Iran were conceded to the opposing side. He believes the deal is ""unacceptable"" because makes Iran an ""exceptional , replacing ‘permission’ with ‘right’ under the NPT, and accepting unconventional measures."" He also believes that the deal has crossed the red lines drew by the Supreme leader of Iran. His testimony was criticized by commission members Masoud Pezeshkian and Abbas Ali Mansouri Arani. In another session, current negotiatiors Abbas Araqchi and Majid Takht-Ravanchi defended the deal, led by Javad Zarif. In the Iranian media, the leading reformist newspapers, Etemad and Shargh, ""continue to write approvingly of the negotiations and their outcome."" Conversely, the leading conservative paper Ettelaat has criticized the agreement. The most ""bombastic and hard-line criticism of the deal"" has come from Kayhan, which is edited by Hossein Shariatmadari and closely associated with Khamenei, the supreme leader. The agreement is supported by many Iranian dissidents, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate, human rights activist, and Iranian exile Shirin Ebadi, who ""labeled as 'extremists' those who opposed the agreement in Iran and America."" Likewise, dissident journalist and former political prisoner Akbar Ganji expressed hope that ""step-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between Iran and Western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from Iran."" Citing Iran's human rights situation and the ""lack of religious and political freedom in the country,"" some dissidents opposed the agreement, including Ahmad Batebi, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, and Roozbeh Farahanipour, who signed an open letter arguing that ""more pressure should be applied to the regime, not less."" On 13 October, the New York Times and many other major U.S. news sources reported that the Iranian Parliament had approved the JPCOA by a vote of 161 votes in favor, 59 against and 13 abstentions. Major Iranian news sources including Fars News Agency and Press TV, referred to as a semi-official government source by U.S. media, reported that what was actually approved was a document consisting of the text of the JPCOA, supplemented by text unilaterally added by Iran and not agreed by the P5+1. On 18 October 2015, EU High Representative Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif jointly announced ""Adoption Day"" for the JCPOA, noting actions taken and planned by the EU, Iran, the IAEA, and the United States, and stating that ""All sides remain strongly committed to ensuring that implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can start as soon as possible."" After the IAEA confirmed that Iran met the relevant requirements under the JCPOA, all nuclear sanctions were lifted by the UN, the EU and the United States on 16 January 2016. Washington imposed new sanctions on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran’s ballistic missile program on the first day of the implementation. According to Kerry, $1.7 billion in debt with interest is to be paid to Tehran. However, some Iranian financial institutions including Ansar Bank, Bank Saderat, Bank Saderat PLC, and Mehr Bank remain on the SDN List and a number of U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran including existing terrorism, human rights and ballistic missiles-related sanctions will remain in place. Some argue that deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons. Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, a supporter of the agreement, wrote it would be better to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran’s enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, ""provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb."" According to Michael Eisenstadt, Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, ""deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years."" Four days after the JCPOA was adopted, Khamenei delivered a speech, highlighting his fatwa and rejecting the claim that the nuclear talks rather than Iran's religious abstinence prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He said: In a letter addressed to Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, President Barack Obama raised the issue about U.S. ability to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons: Ambassador Dennis Ross, former top Mideast official, and General David Petraeus, former CIA director, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that ""Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities"" of the agreement. Petraeus and Ross asserted that if Iran decide to race toward a nuclear weapon ""there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force"", since the threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians. They said the president could resolve their concerns by stating that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including producing highly enriched uranium, even after the deal ends in 15 years. It is ""critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force,” they said. In the same letter, Obama detailed the possible non-military unilateral and multilateral responses to be employed should Iran violate the agreement, however, the president made it clear: ""Ultimately, it is essential that we retain the flexibility to decide what responsive measures we and our allies deem appropriate for any non-compliance."" Flexibility meant that Obama rejected specifying ""the penalties for smaller violations of the accord"" in advance. The open letter, which was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials endorsing the agreement, begins with the words: ""The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran stands as a landmark agreement in deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons."" In contrast, Michael Mandelbaum, the Christian A. Herter Professor at the Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies, wrote that nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East ultimately depended ""not on the details of the Vienna agreement but on the familiar Cold-War policy of deterrence."" Mandelbaum added that if President Obama will leave office without Iran building the bomb, ""the responsibility for conducting a policy of effective deterrence will fall on his successor."" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz expressed his view on deterring Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons as follows: ""Nothing currently on the table will deter Iran. Sanctions are paper protests to an oil-rich nation. Diplomacy has already failed because Russia and China are playing both sides."" With the prospective lifting of some sanctions, the agreement is expected to have a significant impact on both the economy of Iran and global markets. The energy sector is particularly important, with Iran having nearly 10 percent of global oil reserves and 18 percent of natural gas reserves. Millions of barrels of Iranian oil may come onto global markets, lowering the price of crude oil. However, the impact will not be immediate, because Iran will not be able to implement measures that are needed to lift sanctions until the end of 2015. Technology and investment from global integrated oil companies are expected to increase capacity from Iran's oil fields and refineries, which have been in ""disarray"" in recent years, plagued by mismanagement and underinvestment. Senior executives from oil giants Royal Dutch Shell, Total S.A, and Eni met with the Iranian oil minister in Vienna in June, the month before the JCPOA was announced, and have been seeking business opportunities in Iran. The economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; the New York Times reported that ""consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers,"" many of whom are young and prefer Western products. Iran is ""considered a strong emerging market play"" by investment and trading firms. French auto manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroën has emerged as one of the first Western companies to re-establish commercial ties following the deal. In February 2016, after the end of a four year restriction, Iranian banks –except Mehr, Ansar and Saderat banks– reconnected to the SWIFT. However, many Iranian observers including critics of Rouhani's administration, economists and private sector representatives claimed the news was false. According to Financial Times's report, Iran’s banks are indeed being reconnected to SWIFT but there have been “too few” transactions because european and US banks are “worried about the risks” of dealing with them and “scarred by a string of multibillion-dollar fines”. Three months after implementation, Iran has been unable to tap about $100 billion held abroad. One 15 April 2016, Central Bank of Iran Governor Valiollah Seif, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Iran has gotten “almost nothing” from the accord. He also met Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew on the sidelines of his Washington's trip to discuss the concerns. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said that: “the agreement that’s included in the JCPOA does not include giving Iran access to the US financial system or to allow the execution of so-called U-turn transactions."" On 20 April 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on Bank Markazi v. Peterson and ruled that almost $2 billion of Iranian frozen assets must be given to families of people killed in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. The court accused Iran of being responsible for the incident. On 27 November 2016, Schlumberger, the largest oil service company in the world announced that it had signed a preliminary deal to study an Iranian oil field. According to Schlumberger's spokesperson, this was a memorandum of understanding with the state-run National Iranian Oil Company “for the non-disclosure of data required for a technical evaluation of a field development prospect.” In July 2015, Richard Stone wrote in the journal Science in July 2015 that if the agreement is fully implemented, ""Iran can expect a rapid expansion of scientific cooperation with Western powers. As its nuclear facilities are repurposed, scientists from Iran and abroad will team up in areas such as nuclear fusion, astrophysics, and radioisotopes for cancer therapy."" In August 2015, the British embassy in Tehran reopened almost four years after it was closed after protesters attacked the embassy in 2011. At a reopening ceremony, Hammond said that since Rouhani's election as president, British-Iranian relations had gone from a ""low point"" to steady ""step-by-step"" improvement. Hammond said: ""Last month's historic nuclear agreement was another milestone, and showed the power of diplomacy, conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, to solve shared challenges. Re-opening the embassy is the logical next step to build confidence and trust between two great nations."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, reported that the nuclear agreement ""had clearly been decisive in prompting the UK embassy to be reopened,"" stating that British-Iranian ""ties have slowly been warming but it is clearly the successful conclusion of the nuclear accord with Iran that has paved the way for the embassy reopening."" After the adoption of the JCPOA, the United States imposed several new non-nuclear sanctions against Iran, some of which being condemned by Iran as a possible violation of the deal. According to Seyed Mohammad Marandi, professor at the University of Tehran, the general consensus in Iran while the negotiations were taking place was that the United States would move towards increasing sanctions on non-nuclear areas. He said that these post-JCPOA sanctions could ""severely damage the chances for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action bearing fruit"". On March 8 and 9, 2016, the IRGC conducted ballistic missile tests as part of its military drills, with one of the Qadr H missiles carrying the inscription, ""Israel should be wiped off the Earth"". Israel called on Western powers to punish Iran for the tests, which U.S. officials said do not violate the nuclear deal, but may violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the tests were not in violation of the UNSC resolution. On March 17, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian and British companies for involvement in the Iranian ballistic missile program. On May 21, 2016, Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, persisted that ""U.S. must take practical steps"" in the meeting with his New Zealander counterpart Murray McCully.  Hours before the official announcement of the activation of JCPOA on 16 January 2016, Iran released four imprisoned Iranian Americans—Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who had been convicted of espionage, former Marine Corps infantryman Amir Hekmati, who had been convicted of co-operating with hostile governments, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, who was convicted on national security charges, and former Iranian infantryman Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, who was convicted of violating alcohol prohibitions and awaiting trial on espionage charges—in exchange for the United States' release of seven Iranian Americans—Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghahi and Tooraj Faridi, charged with sanctions violations, Nader Modanlo, convicted of helping launch Iranian satellite Sina-1, Arash Ghahreman, convicted of money laundering and sanctions violations for exporting navigation equipment to Iran, Nima Golestaneh, convicted of hacking, and Ali Saboonchi, convicted of sanctions violations—and the dismissal of outstanding charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. A fifth American, student and researcher Matthew Trevithick, left Iran in a separate arrangement. Shahi Hamid of The Atlantic Monthly wrote that the agreement ""had a narrow—if understandable—focus on the minutia of Iran's nuclear program,"" and ""he Obama administration repeatedly underscored that the negotiations weren't about Iran's other activities in the region: They were about the nuclear program."" The U.S. government and observers noted from the time that the framework was entered into in April 2015 ""that the United States and Iran still find themselves on opposite sides of most of the conflicts that have pitched the Arab world into chaos"" and that the agreement was ""unlikely"" to cause Iran to become a firm partner of the West. The narrow nuclear-nonproliferation focus of the deal was criticized by the agreement's opponents (such as Lawrence J. Hass of the American Foreign Policy Council), who argued that the agreement was faulty because it did not address anti-Semitism and threats against Israel, hostility and rhetoric against America and the West in general, illegal missile testing, supplying of arms to terrorist groups, and efforts to destabilize ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen. In October 2015 The Wall Street Journal noted that Iran had recently carried out ballistic missile tests, announced the conviction of Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, launched military operations to maintain Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, and continued shipping arms and money to Houthi rebels in Yemen, the latter two actions fueling fears of a broader regional war. Israel and Saudi Arabia expressed concern about Iran's ability to use diplomatic cover and unfrozen money from the deal to strengthen its regional position and that of its allies. Critics in Washington accused the Obama administration of having been duped by Iran and Russia into accepting a deal that was antithetical to American interests. Meanwhile, the administration was also accused of whitewashing Iran's failure to cooperate fully with the IAEA investigation into the possible military dimensions of its past nuclear work. In November 2015, The New York Times wrote that ""nyone who hoped that Iran’s nuclear agreement with the United States and other powers portended a new era of openness with the West has been jolted with a series of increasingly rude awakenings over the past few weeks."" The Times reported, variously, that the Iranian had invited a Lebanese-American to visit the country, and then arrested him for spying; the Ayatollah made a public statement that the slogan ""Death to America"" was ""eternal""; a wave of anti-American billboards went up in the capital; a backlash by political hard-liners began and the Revolutionary Guard intelligence apparatus ""started rounding up journalists, activists and cultural figures""; state media circulated conspiracy theories about the United States, including that the CIA had downed a Russian civilian passenger jet in Egypt; Iranian and Lebanese citizens in Iran holding dual American citizenship were targeted for arrest on charges of ""spying""; clothing manufacturers were prohibited from selling items featuring the American or British flags; and a state-sponsored demonstration was held outside the U.S. embassy in Tehran on the anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis in 1979. Business Insider reported that a variety of factors made it more likely that Iran's stance would harden once the agreement was in place, with one Iran expert saying that Iran's ""nice, smiling face"" would now disappear as the country pursued more adversarial stances, and policy analysts saying that by negotiating the deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Obama had ""made an investment in the stability of the  regime"". The National Review wrote that the U.S. administration's unwillingness to acknowledge any Iranian noncompliance had left the Iranians in control, and that the deal was undermining international security by emboldening Iran to act as a regional hegemon, at the expense of U.S. influence and credibility. Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot argued in February 2016 that Iran's prohibited missile tests, capture of U.S. naval personnel, and other provocations were a sign that rapprochement hoped for by Iran's Western negotiating partners was not going to happen, saying the government had no interest in accommodating U.S. interests, seeking instead to humiliate the United States and spread propaganda.  Gigot noted Iran's desire to be the dominant power in the Mideast and would work to promote instability there while using the nuclear agreement as a ""shield"" to protect from criticism of its ""imperialist"" behavior. James S. Robbins, an American political commentator and a senior fellow on the American Foreign Policy Council, criticized the nuclear deal as ""impotent"" because it does not limit Iran's ballistic missile program, and UNSC Resolution 2231, which was adopted along with the deal, weakened the limits Iran's ballistic missile program that had been imposed by previous UNSC resolutions. On March 4, 2016, Olli Heinonen, former Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that ""the International Atomic Energy Agency’s most recent report on Iran’s nuclear activities provides insufficient details on important verification and monitoring issues"", and said that the report's lack of detailed data prevented the international community from verifying whether Iran was complying with the deal. On 9 November 2016, Deutsche Welle, citing a source from the IAEA, reported that ""Iran has violated the terms of its nuclear deal"". On 4 December 2016, Iran's President Rouhani warned that Iran would respond firmly to the passage by the U.S. Senate of an extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, which he claimed would violate the nuclear deal. On 1 December 2016, the U.S. Senate voted to renew the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for another decade. The future of nuclear agreement with Iran is uncertain under the administration of President Trump. The Obama Administration and outside experts said the extension would have no practical effect and risked antagonizing Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, President Rouhani, and Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the extension of sanctions would be a breach of the nuclear deal. Some Iranian officials said that Iran might ramp up uranium enrichment in response. In January 2017, representatives from Iran, P5+1 and EU gathered in Vienna’s Palais Coburg hotel to address Iran’s complaint about the US congressional bill.

John Kerry, Secretary of State  On 24 November 2013, the Geneva interim agreement (Persian: توافق هسته‌ای ژنو‎‎), officially titled the Joint Plan of Action (برنامه اقدام مشترک), was a pact signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consists of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. It represented the first formal agreement between the United States and Iran in 34 years. Implementation of the agreement began 20 January 2014. The Joint Plan of Action and the negotiations under it which followed eventually led to an April 2015 framework agreement and then a July 2015 final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.   The nuclear program of Iran has been a matter of contention with the international community since 2002, when an Iranian dissident group revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency, charged with monitoring and ensuring peaceful nuclear activities, referred the matter of Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council in February 2006, after finding that Iran had not been in compliance with its duties as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). For what the IAEA judged to be continued non-compliance, the UN Security Council has voted four times since 2006 to impose limited economic sanctions against Iran. In its resolutions, the Council required Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities. Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations, has emphasized that the resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and ""are legally binding under international law, adding further legal force to the argument that Iran has no legal right whatsoever to enrich uranium"". In addition, the United States and European Union have voluntarily imposed additional sanctions against Iran, targeting its natural resource exports (particularly oil and natural gas), petrochemical, aerospace and automotive industries, banking system, and access to international finance. Iran held a presidential election in June 2013 that was won by Hassan Rouhani, his campaign promised moderation and constructive engagement with the international community over its nuclear program and reverse Iran's international isolation. Rouhani was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005. In addition, the Associated Press reported in November 2013 that officials in the Obama administration had been in contact secretly with Iranian officials throughout 2013 about the feasibility of an agreement over the Iranian atomic program. The report said that American and Iranian officials met face-to-face five times in Oman. The secret meetings, personally authorised by U.S. President Barack Obama, were launched in March 2013 in Muscat, while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in power. Obama informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of these talks when Netanyahu visited the White House on 30 September 2013. In parallel with the implementation of the P5+1 interim agreement IAEA and Iran have agreed on a framework for cooperation that includes practical measures that to resolve questions about Iran's nuclear program, including activities that may be related to nuclear weapons. Previous talks between Iran and the P5+1, chaired by European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton, were held in the Kazakh city of Almaty on 26–27 February and 5–6 April 2013, in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 17–18 March, and in Geneva on 7–8 November—all without agreement. The sides agreed to meet again on 20 November. The 20 November negotiations were attended at the foreign minister level by the participant countries. The talks opened with a short introduction from Lady Ashton and the leader of the Iranian delegation, foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, before the sides began bilateral discussions. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, were present for the Geneva talks but were not announced. They stayed at a separate hotel and entered through service doors. Burns and Sullivan were key members of the back channel that President Obama sent to Oman to meet with Iranian officials. Burns was reported to be ""in the driver's seat"" of the American negotiating team, even though it was officially being led by Kerry and Wendy Sherman. Burns had met secretly with Iranian officials as far back as 2008, when then-President George W. Bush dispatched him. The interim Geneva Accord was signed between P5+1 countries and the Islamic Republic of Iran on 24 November 2013. The deal consists of the short-term freezing of key parts of the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for a decrease in sanctions, as both sides work towards a long-term agreement. The agreement makes the following stipulations on the Iranian nuclear program: In exchange, Iran will receive relief from sanctions of approximately US$7 billion (£4.3 billion) and no additional sanctions will be imposed. The agreement sets a six-month time frame for a more comprehensive follow-up agreement between Iran and the P5+1 negotiators to formalize Iran's nuclear relationship with the world. In addition, sanctions on Iran's auto industry, as well as sanctions on associated services will be suspended. License for the supply and installation in Iran of spare parts for safety of flight for Iranian civil aviation and associated services will be permitted. According to nonproliferation expert David Albright, the blending down of Iran's 20% enriched uranium will lengthen the time required for a nuclear ""breakout"" from 1–1.6 months to 1.9–2.2 months. The terms do not bar Iran from manufacturing components for their nuclear facilities off-site, as long as none of those components are installed. One western diplomat said the impact of this ""loophole"" would be very minor and could serve as a test of Iranian intentions. The minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced that Iran has no intentions to increase the capacity of the Arak site, ""but construction will continue there"". The NPT refers to the ""inalienable right"" to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in conformity with the treaty's nonproliferation provisions. Those provisions obligate non-nuclear states not to acquire (or seek or receive assistance to manufacture) nuclear weapons, and to place all their nuclear material under IAEA safeguards. Safeguards alone cannot provide assurance about a country's future intent, raising concerns that an Iranian enrichment facility under safeguards today could be used as the basis for break-out from non-proliferation commitments in the future. Iran asserts that the NPT guarantees a right to enrichment of uranium. Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei insisted that the right to enrich was a ""red line"" for the Iranian side. In the past, United States and Europeans argued that Iran should forfeit its right to enrich, despite NPT provisions, due to its secret nuclear activities and failure to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards. The interim agreement represents a compromise, and is silent as to whether or not Iran has a right to enrich uranium. It refers to Iran's ""right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes"" and in its first phase allows Iran to continue some enrichment activities. Regarding a comprehensive long-term solution, the text states ""This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution could involve a mutually defined enrichment program with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the program,"" but a footnote makes clear that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."" According to Iran expert Ray Takeyh the agreement showed that uranium enrichment is ""respected in practice but not acknowledged just yet."" A senior U.S. official said ""the United States has not recognized a right to enrich for the Iranian government, nor do we intend to. The document does not say anything about recognizing a right to enrich uranium."" More generally, a senior U.S. official said ""we do not believe any country – not just Iran – has a right to enrichment. The Article IV of the NPT, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, is silent on the issue. It neither confers a right nor denies a right."" According to an editorial in the Washington Post, the published text means that the United States and other powers ""have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely."" The document says the final deal will ""have a specified long-term duration to be agreed upon,"" and after it expires, ""the Iranian nuclear program will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT."" Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated that the agreement ensures Iran's right to enrich. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the American negotiation team, responded saying that: ""There is no inherent right to enrich,"" and that ""And everywhere in this particular agreement it states that they could only do that by mutual agreement, and nothing is agreed on until everything is agreed on."" Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov also stated that the agreement recognized Iran's right to enrichment, so long as the program is under IAEA control. Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman agreed with this assessment of the language in the agreement, although he was displeased by it. Arab nations Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Authority have come out in favor of the temporary agreement. Lebanon also hailed the agreement, while emphasizing that Israel should also sign the NPT and rid itself of its nuclear weapons arsenal. Turkey, India and Pakistan have also welcomed the framework agreement. In a reference to Israel's arsenal of nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia and Qatar both advocated a comprehensive solution to Iran's nuclear issue which would leave the entire Middle East free of nuclear weapons. Reaction from Israeli government politicians was negative. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the accord a ""historic mistake,"" and intelligence minister Yuval Steinitz compared it to failed nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Considering the way Washington handled the deal with Iran The Jerusalem Post questioned whether Netanyahu would ""place Israel's security in the hands of US guarantees"". Leader of the opposition Isaac Herzog criticized Netanyahu's reaction as bad for Israel's relations with the United States, although Herzog also said that Obama was partly to blame for not communicating more closely with Israel. Former Israeli military intelligence chiefs Amos Yadlin and Aharon Ze'evi-Farkash also criticized Netanyahu's reaction as damaging to U.S. relations. The former head of the Israeli National Security Council Yaakov Amidror has listed the reasons the agreement failed to achieve anything significant and came to the conclusion that it ""represents a failure, not a triumph, of diplomacy"". Al Jazeera argued that Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Iran, welcomed the agreement. The Saudi cabinet released a statement which read, in part: ""The government of the kingdom sees that if there was goodwill, this agreement could represent a preliminary step towards a comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear program"" and could eventually lead ""to the removal of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, from the Middle East and the Arab Gulf region"". The Daily Telegraph reported that Nawaf Obaid, a senior advisor to the Saudi royal family, criticized the way the deal was achieved: ""We were lied to, things were hidden from us"". Reaction from the U.S. Congress was mixed. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Peter King were sharply critical of the agreement. Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Adam Smith were more positive. Speaker John Boehner and Democrat Eliot Engel were cautious. Reactions from Canada were ""skeptical"", with Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird saying Iran ""has not earned the right to have the benefit of the doubt."" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hailed the interim agreement as the potential ""beginnings of a historic agreement."" Hezbollah published a declaration and stated this is a triumph for Iran. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee reacted skeptically to the agreement and urged preparation of sanctions legislation in Congress in case it failed, but fell short of calling for new sanctions immediately. Other non-partisan pro-Israel groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, were cautiously welcoming of the agreement after being briefed by White House officials. The representatives of the interim agreement parties announced that implementation of the interim agreement would begin on 20 January 2014. Iran's negotiator, Araghchi disclosed in an interview that certain elements of the interim agreement are fleshed out in a secret 30-page ""side agreement"" or ""nonpaper."" He said it included information about the operation of a joint commission to oversee the interim agreement's implementation. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf denied later that there was any secret agreement. The text of the implementation agreement was not released to the public. US National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said that this is because the EU is not making the document public."" The White House released a summary of technical understandings related to the implementation of the agreement on 16 January. President Barack Obama welcomed the announcement and said: ""Beginning 20 January, Iran will for the first time start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantling some of the infrastructure that makes such enrichment possible."" The Iranian official, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi noted that unilateral interpretations must be prevented and said: ""the use of the word 'dismantle' by Obama was not appropriate."" Implementation began on 20 January 2014, IAEA interim report confirmed that Iran had begun scaling back major nuclear activities, the first steps to implement the interim deal. The report followed by the partial lifting of sanctions by the United States and the EU. Iran's first payment of sanctions relief, of $550 million, is scheduled to be transferred on 1 February. Iran is also scheduled to receive five additional payments of $550 million through the end of July 2014, as well as $900 million in two installments for the dilution of its enriched uranium. European shipping and insurance companies will also be allowed to conduct business with Iranian oil shipments to six countries currently waived from facing U.S. sanctions. Iran

Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister  The P5+1 refers to the UN Security Council's five permanent members (the P5); namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; plus Germany. The P5+1 is often referred to as the E3+3 by European countries. It is a group of six world powers which, in 2006, joined together in diplomatic efforts with Iran with regard to its nuclear program.   In June 2006, China, Russia, and the United States joined the three EU-3 countries, which had been negotiating with Iran since 2003, to offer another proposal for comprehensive negotiations with Iran. Up to then, the UN Security Council has adopted six resolutions in response to the Iranian nuclear program. The first resolution, #1696, was adopted in July 2006 and demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The next three years saw the adoption of three more resolutions, #1737 in December 2006, #1747 in March 2007, and #1803 in March 2008, which have imposed gradual sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities believed to be involved in Iran's nuclear and missile programs. UN Security Council Resolution #1835, adopted in September 2008, restated the Security Council's demands made in resolution #1696 of 2006, but without imposing additional sanctions. The last Security Council resolution, #1929, adopted in June 2010, saw the expansion of more sanctions on Iran for its lack of cooperation and its continued uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities Germany is the key trading partner of Iran. Iran's nuclear program depends mainly upon German products and services. For example, the thousands of centrifuges used to enrich the uranium are controlled by Siemens ""Simatic WinCC Step7"" software. Around 50 German firms have branch offices in Iran, and more than 12,000 firms have trade representatives in Iran. Many well-known German companies are involved in major Iranian infrastructure projects, especially in the petrochemical sector, like Linde, BASF, Lurgi, Krupp, Siemens, ZF Friedrichshafen, Mercedes, Volkswagen, MAN, and Unilever. (2008). In 2005, Germany had the largest share of Iran's export market with $5.67 billion (14.4%). In 2008, German exports to Iran increased by 8.9 percent and comprised 84.7 percent of the total German–Iranian trade volume. The overall bilateral trade volume until the end of September 2008 stood at 3.23 billion euros, compared to 2.98 billion euros the previous year. The value of trade between Germany and Iran increased from around 4.3 billion euro in 2009 to nearly 4.7 billion euro in 2010. The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce has estimated that economic sanctions against Iran may cost more than 10,000 German jobs and have a negative impact on the economic growth of Germany. Sanctions would especially hurt medium-sized German companies, which depend heavily on trade with Iran. There has been a shift in German business ties with Iran from long-term business to short-term and from large to mid-sized companies which have fewer business interests in the US and thus are less prone to U.S. political pressure. A round of the talks between Iran and the P5+1, chaired by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, was held in the Kazakh city of Almaty on 26–27 February 2013. The two sides agreed to meet again in the city on 5–6 April to continue the talks after holding expert-level talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 17–18 March 2013. In a further meeting of the P5+1 in Geneva on 16 October 2013, Iran stated that it may allow unannounced visits to its nuclear sites as a ""last step"" in a proposal to resolve differences with the West. Lowering uranium enrichment levels could also be part of a final deal, according to an Iranian official. On 24 November 2013, an interim agreement was reached between the E3/EU+3 (P5+1 countries and the EU) and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland. It is expected to lead to a six-month freeze and partial rollback of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. It represents the first formal agreement between the United States and Iran in 34 years. U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and the lead negotiator with Iran, Wendy Sherman, told a Senate hearing that Iran's ballistic missile program would be addressed as part of a comprehensive nuclear deal. On 10 February 2014, Iran's defense minister said they successfully test-fired two new domestically made missiles. The next day, Iran laid out ""red lines"" related to its ballistic missile program, atomic sites and uranium enrichment ahead of talks of the next step in nuclear talks, which resumed in Vienna on 18 February. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, also a senior Iranian nuclear negotiator, said ""defense-related issues are a red line for Iran"" and that Tehran ""will not allow such issues to be discussed in future talks."" Senior officials of the P5+1 and Iran met on 18–20 February 2014 in Vienna and agreed on a framework for future negotiations. The P5+1 and Iran planned to have monthly meetings to try and forge a final, comprehensive deal. Former Israeli UN Ambassador Dore Gold claimed that the comprehensive agreement being negotiated between Iran and the P5+1 focused on increased transparency instead of a reduction in nuclear capability. Former U.S. State Department official and advisor on Iran's nuclear program Robert Einhorn said such an agreement would need to both increase transparency and lengthen Iran's timeline for nuclear breakout capability.  Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the United States imposed economic sanctions against Iran and expanded them in 1995 to include firms dealing with the Iranian government. In 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1696 and imposed sanctions after Iran refused to suspend its uranium enrichment program. U.S. sanctions initially targeted investments in oil, gas, and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, and business dealings with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. This encompasses banking and insurance transactions (including with the Central Bank of Iran), shipping, web-hosting services for commercial endeavors, and domain name registration services. Over the years, sanctions have taken a serious toll on Iran's economy and people. Since 1979, the United States has led international efforts to use sanctions to influence Iran's policies, including Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Western governments fear is intended for developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran counters that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, including generating electricity and medical purposes. When nuclear talks between Iran and Western governments were stalled and seen as a failure, they were cited as a reason to enforce stronger economic sanctions on Iran. On 2 April 2015, the P5+1 and Iran, meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, reached a provisional agreement on a framework that, once finalized and implemented, would lift most of the sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear programs extending for at least ten years. As a result, UN sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016.   The UN Security Council passed a number of resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran, following the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors regarding Iran's non-compliance with its safeguards agreement and the Board's finding that Iran's nuclear activities raised questions within the competency of the Security Council. Sanctions were first imposed when Iran rejected the Security Council's demand that Iran suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. Sanctions will be lifted when Iran meets those demands and fulfills the requirements of the IAEA Board of Governors. To-date, Iran sanctions are the toughest the world community has imposed on any country. The European Union has imposed restrictions on cooperation with Iran in foreign trade, financial services, energy sectors and technologies, and banned the provision of insurance and reinsurance by insurers in member states to Iran and Iranian-owned companies. On 23 January 2012, the EU agreed to an oil embargo on Iran, effective from July, and to freeze the assets of Iran's central bank. The next month, Iran symbolically pre-empted the embargo by ceasing sales to Britain and France (both countries had already almost eliminated their reliance on Iranian oil, and Europe as a whole had nearly halved its Iranian imports), though some Iranian politicians called for an immediate sales halt to all EU states, so as to hurt countries like Greece, Spain and Italy who were yet to find alternative sources. On 17 March 2012, all Iranian banks identified as institutions in breach of EU sanctions were disconnected from the SWIFT, the world's hub of electronic financial transactions. One side effect of the sanctions is that the global shipping insurers based in London are unable to provide cover for items as far afield as Japanese shipments of Iranian liquefied petroleum gas to South Korea. On the web site of the U.S. Department of State is written as follows: The website of the U.K. government states: In November 2011 the IAEA reported ""serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme"" and indications that ""some activities may still be ongoing."" According to the Supreme leader of Iran, the real objective of sanctions is ""to prevent Iran from reaching a prominent civilizational status"" (as in history). Europe's General Court overturned European sanctions against two of Iran's biggest banks (Bank Saderat & Bank Mellat); the two banks had filed suit with the European court to challenge those sanctions. The European Union – which for years had condemned America's prospective ""extraterritorial"" application of national trade law and warned it would go to the WTO's Dispute Resolution Mechanism if Washington ever sanctioned European firms over Iran-related business. Russia, China and the other BRICS have also accommodated Washington’s increasing reliance on the threatened imposition of ""secondary"" sanctions against third-country entities doing business with Iran. Removing sanctions against the banks would severely weaken Europe's sanctions regime. Other major players in Iran's economy, including the Central Bank of Iran and the National Iranian Oil Company, are now challenging their own sanctioned status. The sanctions bring difficulties to Iran's $483 billion, oil-dominated economy. Data published by the Iranian Central Bank show a declining trend in the share of Iranian exports from oil-products (2006/2007: 84.9%, 2007/2008: 86.5%, 2008/2009: 85.5%, 2009/2010: 79.8%, 2010/2011 (first three quarters): 78.9%). The sanctions have had a substantial adverse effect on the Iranian nuclear program by making it harder to acquire specialized materials and equipment needed for the program. The social and economic effects of sanctions have also been severe, with even those who doubt their efficacy, such as John Bolton, describing the EU sanctions, in particular, as ""tough, even brutal."" Iranian foreign minister Ali Akhbar Salehi conceded that the sanctions are having an impact. China has become Iran's largest remaining trading partner. Sanctions have reduced Iran's access to products needed for the oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant to do business with Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the way to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state. The value of the Iranian rial has plunged since autumn 2011, it is reported to have devalued up to 80%, falling 10% immediately after the imposition of the EU oil embargo since early October 2012, causing widespread panic among the Iranian public. In January 2012, the country raised the interest rate on bank deposits by up to 6 percentage points in order to curtail the rial's depreciation. The rate increase was a setback for Ahmadinejad, who had been using below-inflation rates to provide cheap loans to the poor, though naturally Iranian bankers were delighted by the increase. Not long after, and just a few days after Iran's economic minister declared that ""there was no economic justification"" for devaluing the currency because Iran's foreign exchange reserves were ""not only good, but the extra oil revenues are unprecedented,"" the country announced its intention to devalue by about 8.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, set a new exchange rate and vowed to reduce the black market's influence (booming, of course, because of the lack of confidence in the rial). The Iranian Central Bank desperately tried to keep the value of the rial afloat in the midst of the late 2012 decline by pumping petrodollars into the system to allow the rial to compete against the US dollar. Efforts to control inflation rates were set forth by the government through a three-tiered-multiple-exchange-rate; this effect has failed to prevent the rise in cost of basic goods, simultaneously adding to the public's reliance on the Iranian black-market exchange rate network. Government officials attempted to stifle the black-market by offering rates 2% below the alleged black-market rates, but demand seems to be outweighing their efforts. Sanctions tightened further when major supertanker companies said they would stop loading Iranian cargo. Prior attempts to reduce Iran's oil income failed because many vessels are often managed by companies outside the United States and the EU; however, EU actions in January extended the ban to ship insurance. This insurance ban will affect 95 percent of the tanker fleet because their insurance falls under rules governed by European law. ""It's the insurance that's completed the ban on trading with Iran,"" commented one veteran ship broker. This completion of the trading ban left Iran struggling to find a buyer for nearly a quarter of its annual oil exports. Iran has sought to manage the impact of international sanctions and limit capital outflows by promoting a ""resistance economy,"" replacing imports with domestic goods and banning luxury imports such as computers and mobile phones. This is predicted to lead to an increase in smuggling, as ""people will find a way to smuggle in what the Iranian consumer wants."" To sustain oil imports, Iran has also provided domestic insurance for tankers shipping Iranian oil. Iran had hoped to sell more to Chinese and Indian refiners, though such attempts seem unlikely to succeed, particularly since China—the single-largest buyer of Iranian crude—has been curtailing its oil imports from Iran down to half their former level. Another effect of the sanctions, in the form of Iran's retaliatory threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, has led to Iraqi plans to open export routes for its crude via Syria, though Iraq's deputy prime minister for energy affairs doubted Iran would ever attempt a closure. After Iranian banks blacklisted by the EU were disconnected from the SWIFT banking network, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz stated that Iran would now find it more difficult to export oil and import products. According to Steinitz, Iran would be forced to accept only cash or gold, which is impossible when dealing with billions of dollars. Steinitz told the Israeli cabinet that Iran's economy might collapse as a result. The effects of the sanctions are usually denied in the Iranian press. Iran has also taken measures to circumvent sanctions, notably by using front countries or companies and by using barter trade. At other times the Iranian government has advocated a ""resistance economy"" in response to sanctions, such as using more oil internally as export markets dry up and import substitution industrialization of Iran. In October 2012, Iran began struggling to halt a decline in oil exports which could plummet further due to Western sanctions, and the International Energy Agency estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000 bpd in September 2012 from 2.2 million bpd at the end of 2011. The results of this fall led to a drop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency, the rial, collapsed. The output in September 2012 was Iran's lowest since 1988. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast has said that the sanctions were not just aimed at Iran's nuclear program and would continue even if the nuclear dispute was resolved. In the face of increased economic pressure from the United States and Europe and a marked decrease of oil exports, Iran is seeking to build a resistance economy as well as ongoing gold imports from Turkey. 94 Iranian Parliamentarians signed a formal request to have Ahmadinejad appear before the Majles (parliament) to answer questions about the currency crisis. The Supreme Leader terminated the parliament's request in order to unify the government in the face of international pressure. Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad has been called to questioning by parliament on a number of occasions, to justify his position on issues concerning domestic politics. His ideologies seem to have alienated a large portion of the parliament, and stand in contrast to the standpoint of the Supreme Leader. A recent report by Dr. Kenneth Katzman, for the Congressional Research Service, listed the following factors as major examples of economic mismanagement on the part of the Iranian government: According to the U.S., Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl). Opening Iran’s market place to foreign investment could also be a boon to competitive U.S. multinational firms operating in a variety of manufacturing and service sectors. In 2012, the U.S. Energy Department warned that imposing oil embargoes on Iran would increase world oil prices by widening the gap between supply and demand. On the other side, according to a US bipartisan study, oil prices ""could double"" if Iran is permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon. U.S. gross domestic product could fall by about 0.6% in the first year—costing the economy some $90 billion—and by up to 2.5% (or $360 billion) by the third year. This is enough, at current growth rates, to send the country into recession. Pharmaceuticals and medical equipment do not fall under international sanctions, but Iran is facing shortages of drugs for the treatment of 30 illnesses—including cancer, heart and breathing problems, thalassemia and multiple sclerosis (MS)—because it is not allowed to use international payment systems. A teenage boy died from haemophilia because of a shortage of medicine caused by the sanctions. Deliveries of some agricultural products to Iran have also been affected for the same reasons. Drug imports to Iran from the U.S. and Europe decreased by approximately 30 percent in 2012, according to a report by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In 2013, The Guardian reported that some 85,000 cancer patients required forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that had become scarce. Western governments have built waivers into the sanctions regime to ensure that essential medicines get through, but those waivers conflict with blanket restrictions on banking, as well as bans on ""dual-use"" chemicals that might have a military as well as a medical application. An estimated 40,000 haemophiliacs cannot get blood-clotting medicines, and operations on haemophiliacs have been virtually suspended because of the risks created by the shortages. An estimated 23,000 Iranians with HIV/AIDS have severely restricted access to the drugs they need. The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, deferoxamine, used to control the iron content in the blood. Further, Iran can no longer buy medical equipment such as autoclaves, essential for the production of many drugs, because some of the biggest Western pharmaceutical companies refuse to do business with the country. Journalists have reported on the development of a black market for medicine. Though vital drugs are not affected directly by the sanctions, the amount of hard currency available to the minister of health is severely limited. Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi, Iran's first female government minister since the Iranian Revolution, was dismissed in December 2012 for speaking out against the lack of support from the government in times of economic hardship. Furthermore, Iranian patients are at risk of amplified side effects and reduced effectiveness because Iran is forced to import medicines, and chemical building blocks for other medicines, from India and China, as opposed to obtaining higher-quality products from Western manufacturers. Because of patent protections, substitutions for advanced medicines are often unattainable, particularly when it comes to diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. The ""Civil Movement"" was initiated by two prominent Iranian economists—Dr. Mousa Ghaninejad, of Tehran's Petroleum University of Technology, and Dr. Mohammad Mehdi Behkish, of Tehran's Allameh Tabatabaei University—on 14 July 2013. They described the sanctions as an ""unfair"" and ""illogical"" tool, arguing that a freer economy would lead to less political enmity and encourage amicable relationships between countries. They also noted that sanctions against one country punish not only the people of that country, but also the people of its trade partners. The movement was supported by a large group of intellectuals, academics, civil society activists, human rights activists and artists. In September 2013, the International Chamber of Commerce-Iran posted an open letter by 157 Iranian economists, lawyers and journalists criticizing the humanitarian consequences of sanctions and calling on their colleagues across the world to pressure their governments to take steps to resolve the underlying conflict. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately 11 billion 1980-US dollars of its assets. In recent years, billions of dollars of Iranian assets abroad have been seized or frozen, including a building in New York City, and bank accounts in Great Britain, Luxembourg, Japan and Canada. In 2012, Iran reported that the assets of Guard-linked companies in several countries have been frozen but in some cases the assets have been returned. The chairman of the Majlis Planning and Budget Committee says $100 billion of Iran’s money is frozen in foreign banks because of the sanctions imposed on the country. As of 2013, only $30 billion to $50 billion of its foreign exchange reserves (i.e. roughly 50% of total) is accessible because of sanctions. With the accord between Iran and the P5+1 now reached, sanctions relief will affect the economy of Iran in four principal ways: According to the Central Bank of Iran, Iran will use funds unfrozen by its nuclear deal mainly to finance domestic investments, keeping the money abroad until it is needed. On January 16, 2016, it was announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency that the nation had adequately dismantled its nuclear weapons program, allowing for the United Nations to lift sanctions immediately. According to the Washington Institute in 2015: ""The pre-deal asset freeze did not have as great an impact on the Iranian government as some statements from Washington suggested. And going forward, the post-deal relaxation of restrictions will not have as great an impact as some critics of the deal suggest."" U.S. and EU leaders are trying to tighten restrictions on business with Iran, which produced 3.55 million barrels of crude a day in January, 11 percent of OPEC's total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nuclear program of Iran has included several research sites, two uranium mines, a research reactor, and uranium processing facilities that include three known uranium enrichment plants. In 1970, Iran ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), making its nuclear program subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification. The program was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Iran's nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the Shah of Iran. Following the 1979 Revolution, most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. In 1981, Iranian officials concluded that the country's nuclear development should continue. Negotiations took place with France in the late 1980s and with Argentina in the early 1990s, and agreements were reached. In the 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran, providing Iran with Russian nuclear experts and technical information. In the 2000s, the revelation of Iran's clandestine uranium enrichment program raised concerns that it might be intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran. In 2006, because of Iran's noncompliance with its NPT obligations, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. In 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time. Iran's first nuclear power plant, the Bushehr I reactor, was completed with major assistance from the Russian government agency Rosatom and officially opened on 12 September 2011. The Russian engineering contractor Atomenergoprom said the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant would reach full capacity by the end of 2012. Iran has also announced that it is working on a new 360 MW nuclear power plant to be located in Darkhovin, and that it will seek more medium-sized nuclear power plants and uranium mines in the future. As of 2015, Iran's nuclear program has cost $100 billion in lost oil revenues and lost foreign direct investment because of international sanctions ($500 billion, when including other opportunity costs). The foundations for Iran's nuclear program were laid on 5 March 1957, when a ""proposed agreement for cooperation in research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy"" was announced under the auspices of Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program. In 1967, the Tehran Nuclear Research Center (TNRC) was established, run by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). The TNRC was equipped with a U.S.-supplied, 5-megawatt nuclear research reactor, which was fueled by highly enriched uranium. Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and ratified it in 1970, making Iran's nuclear program subject to IAEA verification. The Shah approved plans to construct up to 23 nuclear power stations by 2000. In March 1974, the Shah envisioned a time when the world's oil supply would run out, and declared, ""Petroleum is a noble material, much too valuable to burn ... We envision producing, as soon as possible, 23,000 megawatts of electricity using nuclear plants."" U.S. and European companies scrambled to do business in Iran. Bushehr, the first plant, would supply energy to the city of Shiraz. In 1975, the Erlangen/Frankfurt firm Kraftwerk Union AG, a joint venture of Siemens AG and AEG, signed a contract worth $4 to $6 billion to build the pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant. Construction of the two 1,196 MWe, and was to have been completed in 1981. In 1975 Sweden's 10% share in Eurodif went to Iran. The French government subsidiary company Cogéma and the Iranian Government established the Sofidif (Société franco–iranienne pour l'enrichissement de l'uranium par diffusion gazeuse) enterprise with 60% and 40% shares, respectively. In turn, Sofidif acquired a 25% share in Eurodif, which gave Iran its 10% share of Eurodif. Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi lent 1 billion dollars (and another 180 million dollars in 1977) for the construction of the Eurodif factory, to have the right of buying 10% of the production of the site. ""President Gerald Ford signed a directive in 1976 offering Tehran the chance to buy and operate a U.S.-built reprocessing facility for extracting plutonium from nuclear reactor fuel. The deal was for a complete 'nuclear fuel cycle'."" The Ford strategy paper said the ""introduction of nuclear power will both provide for the growing needs of Iran's economy and free remaining oil reserves for export or conversion to petrochemicals."" A 1974 CIA proliferation assessment stated ""If  is alive in the mid-1980s ... and if other countries  have proceeded with weapons development we have no doubt Iran will follow suit."" Following the 1979 Revolution, most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. Kraftwerk Union stopped working at the Bushehr nuclear project in January 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete, and they fully withdrew from the project in July 1979. The company said they based their action on Iran's non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments, while other sources claim the construction was halted under pressure from the United States. The United States cut off the supply of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel for the Tehran Nuclear Research Center, which forced the reactor to shut down for a number of years. The French Eurodif international enrichment facility stopped supplying enriched uranium to Iran as well. Iran has later argued that these experiences indicate foreign facilities and foreign fuel supplies are an unreliable source of nuclear fuel supply. In 1981, Iranian governmental officials concluded that the country's nuclear development should continue. Reports to the IAEA included that a site at Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTEC) would act ""as the center for the transfer and development of nuclear technology, as well as contribute to the formation of local expertise and manpower needed to sustain a very ambitious program in the field of nuclear power reactor technology and fuel cycle technology."" The IAEA also was informed about Entec's largest department, for materials testing, which was responsible for UO
2 pellet fuel fabrication and a chemical department whose goal was the conversion of U
3O
8 to nuclear grade UO
2. In 1983, IAEA officials were keen to assist Iran in chemical aspects of reactor fuel fabrication, chemical engineering and design aspects of pilot plants for uranium conversion, corrosion of nuclear materials, LWR fuel fabrication, and pilot plant development for production of nuclear grade UO
2. However, the U.S. government ""directly intervened"" to discourage IAEA assistance in Iranian production of UO
2 and UF
6. A former U.S. official said ""we stopped that in its tracks."" Iran later set up a bilateral cooperation on fuel cycle related issues with China, but China also agreed to drop most outstanding nuclear commerce with Iran, including the construction of the UF
6 plant, due to U.S. pressure. In April 1984, West German intelligence reported that Iran might have a nuclear bomb within two years with uranium from Pakistan. The Germans leaked this news in the first public Western intelligence report of a post-revolutionary nuclear weapons program in Iran. Later that year, Minority Whip of the United States Senate Alan Cranston asserted that the Islamic Republic of Iran was seven years away from being able to build its own nuclear weapon. During the Iran–Iraq War, the two Bushehr reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi air strikes and work on the nuclear program came to a standstill. Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of the blasts, and complained about international inaction and the use of French made missiles in the attack. In 1985, Iran began to blackmail France in order to recover its debt from the Eurodif's investment and to get the enriched uranium delivered. French hostages were taken in Lebanon from spring 1985; in 1986, terror attacks were perpetrated in Paris and Eurodif manager Georges Besse was assassinated. In their investigation La République atomique, France-Iran le pacte nucléaire, David Carr-Brown and Dominique Lorentz pointed to the Iranian intelligence services' responsibility. On May 6, 1988, French premier Jacques Chirac signed an accord with Iran: France agreed to accept Iran back in its share-holder status of Eurodif and to deliver it enriched uranium ""without restrictions"". In 1987–88, Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission signed an agreement with Iran to help in converting the reactor from highly enriched uranium fuel to 19.75% low-enriched uranium, and to supply the low-enriched uranium to Iran. According to a report by the Argentine justice in 2006, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its nuclear cooperation with Iran, and from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987–88. Some have linked attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the AMIA bombing as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements. The uranium was delivered in 1993. From the beginning of the 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran called Persepolis which provided Iran with Russian nuclear experts, and technical information. Five Russian institutions, including the Russian Federal Space Agency helped Tehran to improve its missiles. The exchange of technical information with Iran was personally approved by the SVR director Trubnikov. President Boris Yeltsin had a ""two track policy"" offering commercial nuclear technology to Iran and discussing the issues with Washington. In 1991 France refunded more than 1.6 billion dollars, Iran remained shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif. However, Iran refrained from asking for the produced uranium. In 1992 Iran invited IAEA inspectors to visit all the sites and facilities they asked. Director General Blix reported that all activities observed were consistent with the peaceful use of atomic energy. The IAEA visits included undeclared facilities and Iran's nascent uranium mining project at Saghand. In the same year, Argentine officials disclosed that their country had canceled a sale to Iran of civilian nuclear equipment worth $18 million, under US pressure. In 1995, Iran signed a contract with Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy to resume work on the partially complete Bushehr plant, installing into the existing Bushehr I building a 915 MWe VVER-1000 pressurized water reactor, with completion expected in 2009. In 1996, the U.S. convinced the People's Republic of China to pull out of a contract to construct a uranium conversion plant. However, the Chinese provided blueprints for the facility to the Iranians, who advised the IAEA that they would continue work on the program, and IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei even visited the construction site. In 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) first reported that Iran had not declared sensitive enrichment and reprocessing activities. Enrichment can be used to produce uranium for reactor fuel or (at higher enrichment levels) for weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful, and has enriched uranium to less than 5%, consistent with fuel for a civilian nuclear power plant. Iran also claims that it was forced to resort to secrecy after US pressure caused several of its nuclear contracts with foreign governments to fall through. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran's noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the UN Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its nuclear enrichment activities while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has argued that the sanctions are ""illegal,"" imposed by ""arrogant powers,"" and that Iran has decided to pursue the monitoring of its self-described peaceful nuclear program through ""its appropriate legal path,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency. After public allegations about Iran's previously undeclared nuclear activities, the IAEA launched an investigation that concluded in November 2003 that Iran had systematically failed to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards agreement to report those activities to the IAEA, although it also reported no evidence of links to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA Board of Governors delayed a formal finding of non-compliance until September 2005, and reported that non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran's noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the United Nations Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. The Council imposed sanctions after Iran refused to do so. A May 2009 U.S. Congressional Report suggested ""the United States, and later the Europeans, argued that Iran's deception meant it should forfeit its right to enrich, a position likely to be up for negotiation in talks with Iran."" In exchange for suspending its enrichment program, Iran has been offered ""a long-term comprehensive arrangement which would allow for the development of relations and cooperation with Iran based on mutual respect and the establishment of international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program."" However, Iran has consistently refused to give up its enrichment program, arguing that the program is necessary for its energy security, that such ""long term arrangements"" are inherently unreliable, and would deprive it of its inalienable right to peaceful nuclear technology. In June 2009, in the immediate wake of the disputed Iranian presidential election, Iran initially agreed to a deal to relinquish its stockpile of low-enriched uranium in return for fuel for a medical research reactor, but then backed out of the deal. Currently, thirteen states possess operational enrichment or reprocessing facilities, and several others have expressed an interest in developing indigenous enrichment programs. Iran's position was endorsed by the Non-Aligned Movement, which expressed concern about the potential monopolization of nuclear fuel production. To address concerns that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran has offered to place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into reactor fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods to reduce the risk that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States has insisted that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program. In every other case in which the IAEA Board of Governors made a finding of safeguards non-compliance involving clandestine enrichment or reprocessing, the resolution has involved (in the cases of Iraq and Libya) or is expected to involve (in the case of North Korea) at a minimum ending sensitive fuel cycle activities. According to Pierre Goldschmidt, former deputy director general and head of the department of safeguards at the IAEA, and Henry D. Sokolski, Executive Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, some other instances of safeguards noncompliance reported by the IAEA Secretariat (South Korea, Egypt) were never reported to the Security Council because the IAEA Board of Governors never made a formal finding of non-compliance. Though South Korea's case involved enriching uranium to levels near weapons grade, the country itself voluntarily reported the isolated activity and Goldschmidt has argued ""political considerations also played a dominant role in the board's decision"" to not make a formal finding of non-compliance. Estimating when Iran might possibly achieve nuclear ""breakout"" capability, defined as having produced a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium to fuel a weapon – if a working design for one existed and the political decision to assemble it was made – is uncertain. A detailed analysis by physicists at the Federation of American Scientists concludes that such an estimate would depend on the total number and overall efficiency of the centrifuges Iran has in operation, and the amount of low-enriched uranium it has stockpiled to serve as ""feedstock"" for a possible high-enrichment program. A 23 March 2012 U.S. Congressional Research Service report quotes 24 February 2012 IAEA report saying that Iran has stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-percent-enriched uranium – an enrichment level necessary for medical applications – as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels. The authoritarian political culture of Iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many technical specialists. Some experts argue that the intense focus on Iran's nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic. U.S. intelligence agency officials interviewed by The New York Times in March 2012 said they continued to assess that Iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate said Iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued. The Israeli Mossad reportedly shared this belief. On 14 August 2002, Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for an Iranian dissident group National Council of Resistance of Iran, publicly revealed the existence of two nuclear sites under construction: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. It has been strongly suggested that intelligence agencies already knew about these facilities but the reports had been classified. The IAEA immediately sought access to these facilities and further information and co-operation from Iran regarding its nuclear program. According to arrangements in force at the time for implementation of Iran's safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Iran was not required to allow IAEA inspections of a new nuclear facility until six months before nuclear material is introduced into that facility. At the time, Iran was not even required to inform the IAEA of the existence of the facility. This ""six months"" clause was standard for implementation of all IAEA safeguards agreements until 1992, when the IAEA Board of Governors decided that facilities should be reported during the planning phase, even before construction began. Iran was the last country to accept that decision, and only did so 26 February 2003, after the IAEA investigation began. In May 2003, shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, elements of the Iranian government of Mohammad Khatami made a confidential proposal for a ""Grand Bargain"" through Swiss diplomatic channels. It offered full transparency of Iran's nuclear program and withdrawal of support for Hamas and Hezbollah, in exchange for security assurances from the United States and a normalization of diplomatic relations. The Bush Administration did not respond to the proposal, as senior U.S. officials doubted its authenticity. The proposal reportedly was widely blessed by the Iranian government, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU-3) undertook a diplomatic initiative with Iran to resolve questions about its nuclear program. On 21 October 2003, in Tehran, the Iranian government and EU-3 Foreign Ministers issued a statement known as the Tehran Declaration in which Iran agreed to co-operate with the IAEA, to sign and implement an Additional Protocol as a voluntary, confidence-building measure, and to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities during the course of the negotiations. The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide ""satisfactory assurances"" regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an Additional Protocol on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol. The IAEA reported 10 November 2003, that ""it is clear that Iran has failed in a number of instances over an extended period of time to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement with respect to the reporting of nuclear material and its processing and use, as well as the declaration of facilities where such material has been processed and stored."" Iran was obligated to inform the IAEA of its importation of uranium from China and subsequent use of that material in uranium conversion and enrichment activities. It was also obligated to report to the IAEA experiments with the separation of plutonium. However, the Islamic Republic reneged on its promise to permit the IAEA to carry out their inspections and suspended the Additional Protocol agreement outlined above in October 2005. A comprehensive list of Iran's specific ""breaches"" of its IAEA safeguards agreement, which the IAEA described as part of a ""pattern of concealment,"" can be found in a 15 November 2004 report of the IAEA on Iran's nuclear program. Iran attributes its failure to report certain acquisitions and activities on US obstructionism, which reportedly included pressuring the IAEA to cease providing technical assistance to Iran's uranium conversion program in 1983. On the question of whether Iran had a hidden nuclear weapons program, the IAEA's November 2003 report states that it found ""no evidence"" that the previously undeclared activities were related to a nuclear weapons program, but also that it was unable to conclude that Iran's nuclear program was exclusively peaceful. In June 2004, construction was commenced on IR-40, a 40 MW heavy water reactor. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, on 14 November 2004, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator announced a voluntary and temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment program (enrichment is not a violation of the NPT) and the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol, after pressure from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany acting on behalf of the European Union (EU, known in this context as the EU-3). The measure was said at the time to be a voluntary, confidence-building measure, to continue for some reasonable period of time (six months being mentioned as a reference) as negotiations with the EU-3 continued. On 24 November, Iran sought to amend the terms of its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four days later. According to Seyyed Hossein Mousavian, one of the Iranian representatives to the Paris Agreement negotiations, the Iranians made it clear to their European counterparts that Iran would not consider a permanent end to uranium enrichment: In February 2005, Iran pressed the EU-3 to speed up talks, which the EU-3 refused to do so. The talks made little progress because of the divergent positions of the two sides. Under pressure from US the European negotiators could not agree to allow enrichment on Iranian soil. Although Iranians presented an offer, which included voluntary restrictions on the enrichment volume and output, it was rejected. The EU-3 broke a commitment they had made to recognize Iran's right under NPT to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In early August 2005, after the June election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran's President, Iran removed seals on its uranium enrichment equipment in Isfahan, which UK officials termed a ""breach of the Paris Agreement"" though a case can be made that the EU violated the terms of the Paris Agreement by demanding that Iran abandon nuclear enrichment. Several days later, the EU-3 offered Iran a package in return for permanent cessation of enrichment. Reportedly, it included benefits in the political, trade and nuclear fields, as well as long-term supplies of nuclear materials and assurances of non-aggression by the EU (but not the US). Mohammad Saeedi, the deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization rejected the offer, terming it ""very insulting and humiliating"" and other independent analysts characterized the EU offer as an ""empty box"". Iran's announcement that it would resume enrichment preceded the election of Iranian President Ahmadinejad by several months. The delay in restarting the program was to allow the IAEA to re-install monitoring equipment. The actual resumption of the program coincided with the election of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, and the appointment of Ali Larijani as the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator. Around 2005, Germany refused to export any more nuclear equipment or refund money paid by Iran for such equipment in the 1980s. (See European reactions 1979–89.) In August 2005, with the assistance of Pakistan a group of US government experts and international scientists concluded that traces of bomb-grade uranium found in Iran came from contaminated Pakistani equipment and were not evidence of a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iran. In September 2005, IAEA Director General Mohammad ElBaradei reported that ""most"" highly enriched uranium traces found in Iran by agency inspectors came from imported centrifuge components, validating Iran's claim that the traces were due to contamination. Sources in Vienna and the State Department reportedly stated that, for all practical purposes, the HEU issue has been resolved. In a speech to the United Nations on 17 September 2005, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested that Iran’s enrichment might be managed by an international consortium, with Iran sharing ownership with other countries. The offer was rejected out of hand by the EU and the United States. The IAEA Board of Governors deferred a formal decision on Iran's nuclear case for two years after 2003, while Iran continued cooperation with the EU-3. On 24 September 2005, after Iran abandoned the Paris Agreement, the Board found that Iran had been in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, based largely on facts that had been reported as early as November 2003. On 4 February 2006, the 35 member Board of Governors of the IAEA voted 27–3 (with five abstentions: Algeria, Belarus, Indonesia, Libya and South Africa) to report Iran to the UN Security Council. The measure was sponsored by the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and it was backed by the United States. Two permanent council members, Russia and China, agreed to referral only on condition that the council take no action before March. The three members who voted against referral were Venezuela, Syria and Cuba. In response, on 6 February 2006, Iran suspended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other voluntary and non-legally binding cooperation with the IAEA beyond what is required by its safeguards agreement. In late February 2006, IAEA Director Mohammad El-Baradei raised the suggestion of a deal, whereby Iran would give up industrial-scale enrichment and instead limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be willing to give up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration made it clear that they would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran. The IAEA Board of Governors deferred the formal report to the UN Security Council of Iran's non-compliance (such a report is required by Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute), until 27 February 2006. The Board usually makes decisions by consensus, but in a rare non-consensus decision it adopted this resolution by vote, with 12 abstentions. On 11 April 2006, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully enriched uranium. President Ahmadinejad made the announcement in a televised address from the northeastern city of Mashhad, where he said ""I am officially announcing that Iran joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology."" The uranium was enriched to 3.5% using over a hundred centrifuges. On 13 April 2006, after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said (on 12 April 2006) the Security Council must consider ""strong steps"" to induce Tehran to change course in its nuclear ambition; President Ahmadinejad vowed that Iran will not back away from uranium enrichment and that the world must treat Iran as a nuclear power, saying ""Our answer to those who are angry about Iran achieving the full nuclear fuel cycle is just one phrase. We say: Be angry at us and die of this anger,"" because ""We won't hold talks with anyone about the right of the Iranian nation to enrich uranium."" On 14 April 2006, The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) published a series of analyzed satellite images of Iran's nuclear facilities at Natanz and Esfahan. Featured in these images is a new tunnel entrance near the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) at Esfahan and continued construction at the Natanz uranium enrichment site. In addition, a series of images dating back to 2002 shows the underground enrichment buildings and its subsequent covering by soil, concrete, and other materials. Both facilities were already subject to IAEA inspections and safeguards. On 28 July 2006, the UN Security Council approved a resolution to give Iran until the end of August to suspend uranium enrichment or face the threat of sanctions. Iran responded to the demand to stop enrichment of uranium 24 August 2006, offering to return to the negotiation table but refusing to end enrichment. Qolam Ali Hadad-adel, speaker of Iran's parliament, said on 30 August 2006, that Iran had the right to ""peaceful application of nuclear technology and all other officials agree with this decision,"" according to the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. ""Iran opened the door to negotiations for Europe and hopes that the answer which was given to the nuclear package would bring them to the table."" In Resolution 1696 of 31 July 2006, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment and reprocessing related activities. In UN Security Council Resolution 1737 of 26 December 2006, the Council imposed a series of sanctions on Iran for its non-compliance with the earlier Security Council resolution deciding that Iran suspend enrichment-related activities without delay. These sanctions were primarily targeted against the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies and, in response to concerns of China and Russia, were lighter than that sought by the United States. This resolution followed a report from the IAEA that Iran had permitted inspections under its safeguards agreement but had not suspended its enrichment-related activities. The UN Security Council has passed eight resolutions on Iran: The IAEA has consistently stated it is unable to conclude that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Such a conclusion would normally be drawn only for countries that have an Additional Protocol in force. Iran ceased its implementation of the Additional Protocol in 2006, and also ceased all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond what Iran acknowledges it is required to provide under its safeguards agreement, after the IAEA Board of Governors decided, in February 2006, to report Iran's safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council. The UN Security Council, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, then passed Resolution 1737, which obligated Iran to implement the Additional Protocol. Iran responded that its nuclear activities were peaceful and that Security Council involvement was malicious and unlawful. In August 2007, Iran and the IAEA entered into an agreement on the modalities for resolving remaining outstanding issues, and made progress in outstanding issues except for the question of ""alleged studies"" of weaponization by Iran. Iran says it did not address the alleged studies in the IAEA work plan because they were not included in the plan. The IAEA has not detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies and says it regrets it is unable to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, but says the documentation is comprehensive and detailed so that it needs to be taken seriously. Iran says the allegations are based on ""forged"" documents and ""fabricated"" data, and that it has not received copies of the documentation to enable it to prove that they were forged and fabricated. Since 2011, the IAEA has voiced growing concern over possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, and has released a number of reports chastising Iran's nuclear program to that effect. In February 2007, anonymous diplomats at the atomic energy agency reportedly complained that most U.S. intelligence shared with the IAEA had proved inaccurate, and none had led to significant discoveries inside Iran. On 10 May 2007, Iran and the IAEA vehemently denied reports that Iran had blocked IAEA inspectors when they sought access to the Iran's enrichment facility. On 11 March 2007, Reuters quoted International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman Marc Vidricaire, ""We have not been denied access at any time, including in the past few weeks. Normally we do not comment on such reports but this time we felt we had to clarify the matter ... If we had a problem like that we would have to report to the  board ... That has not happened because this alleged event did not take place."" On 30 July 2007, inspectors from the IAEA spent five hours at the Arak complex, the first such visit since April. Visits to other plants in Iran were expected during the following days. It has been suggested that access may have been granted in an attempt to head off further sanctions. An IAEA report to the Board of Governors on 30 August 2007, stated that Iran's Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz is operating ""well below the expected quantity for a facility of this design,"" and that 12 of the intended 18 centrifuge cascades at the plant were operating. The report stated that the IAEA had ""been able to verify the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials at the enrichment facilities in Iran,"" and that longstanding issues regarding plutonium experiments and HEU contamination on spent fuel containers were considered ""resolved."" However, the report added that the Agency remained unable to verify certain aspects relevant to the scope and nature of Iran's nuclear program. The report also outlined a work plan agreed by Iran and the IAEA on 21 August 2007. The work plan reflected agreement on ""modalities for resolving the remaining safeguards implementation issues, including the long outstanding issues."" According to the plan, these modalities covered all remaining issues regarding Iran's past nuclear program and activities. The IAEA report described the work plan as ""a significant step forward,"" but added ""the Agency considers it essential that Iran adheres to the time line defined therein and implements all the necessary safeguards and transparency measures, including the measures provided for in the Additional Protocol."" Although the work plan did not include a commitment by Iran to implement the Additional Protocol, IAEA safeguards head Olli Heinonen observed that measures in the work plan ""for resolving our outstanding issues go beyond the requirements of the Additional Protocol."" According to Reuters, the report was likely to blunt Washington's push for more severe sanctions against Iran. One senior UN official familiar said U.S. efforts to escalate sanctions against Iran would provoke a nationalistic backlash by Iran that would set back the IAEA investigation in Iran. In late October 2007, chief IAEA inspector Olli Heinonen described Iranian cooperation with the IAEA as ""good,"" although much remained to be done. In late October 2007, according to the International Herald Tribune, the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that he had seen ""no evidence"" of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The IHT quoted ElBaradei as saying ""We have information that there has been maybe some studies about possible weaponization. That's why we have said that we cannot give Iran a pass right now, because there is still a lot of question marks. ... But have we seen Iran having the nuclear material that can readily be used into a weapon? No. Have we seen an active weaponization program? No."" The IHT report went on to say that ""ElBaradei said he was worried about the growing rhetoric from the U.S., which he noted focused on Iran's alleged intentions to build a nuclear weapon rather than evidence the country was actively doing so. If there is actual evidence, ElBaradei said he would welcome seeing it."" 15 November 2007, IAEA report found that on nine outstanding issues listed in the August 2007 workplan, including experiments on the P-2 centrifuge and work with uranium metals, ""Iran's statements are consistent with ... information available to the agency,"" but it warned that its knowledge of Tehran's present atomic work was shrinking due to Iran's refusal to continue voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol, as it had done in the past under the October 2003 Tehran agreement and the November 2004 Paris agreement. The only remaining issues were traces of HEU found at one location, and allegations by US intelligence agencies based on a laptop computer allegedly stolen from Iran which reportedly contained nuclear weapons-related designs. The IAEA report also stated that Tehran continues to produce LEU. Iran has declared it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology under the NPT, despite Security Council demands that it cease its nuclear enrichment. On 18 November 2007, President Ahmadinejad announced that he intended to consult with Arab nations on a plan, under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to enrich uranium in a neutral third country, such as Switzerland. Israel criticised IAEA reports on Iran as well as the former IAEA-director ElBaradei. Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman dismissed reports by the UN nuclear watchdog agency as being ""unacceptable"" and accused IAEA head ElBaradei of being ""pro-Iranian."" On 11 February 2008, news reports stated that the IAEA report on Iran's compliance with the August 2007 work plan would be delayed over internal disagreements over the report's expected conclusions that the major issues had been resolved. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated that he would meet with IAEA Director Mohammed ElBaradei to convince him to ""listen to the West"" and remind him that the IAEA is merely in charge of the ""technical side"" rather than the ""political side"" of the issue. A senior IAEA official denied the reports of internal disagreements and accused Western powers of using the same ""hype"" tactics employed against Iraq before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to justify imposing further sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. The IAEA issued its report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran on 22 February 2008. With respect to the report, IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei stated that ""We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran´s enrichment programme"" with the exception of a single issue, ""and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past."" According to the report, the IAEA shared intelligence with Iran recently provided by the US regarding ""alleged studies"" on a nuclear weaponization program. The information was allegedly obtained from a laptop computer smuggled out of Iran and provided to the US in mid-2004. The laptop was reportedly received from a ""longtime contact"" in Iran who obtained it from someone else now believed to be dead. A senior European diplomat warned ""I can fabricate that data,"" and argued that the documents look ""beautiful, but is open to doubt."" The United States has relied on the laptop to prove that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. In November 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) believed that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. Iran has dismissed the laptop information as a fabrication, and other diplomats have dismissed the information as relatively insignificant and coming too late. The February 2008 IAEA report states that the Agency has ""not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard."" On 26 May 2008, the IAEA issued another regular report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran. According to the report, the IAEA has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, and Iran has provided the Agency with access to declared nuclear material and accountancy reports, as required by its safeguards agreement. Iran had installed several new centrifuges, including more advanced models, and environmental samples showed the centrifuges ""continued to operate as declared"", making low-enriched uranium. The report also noted that other elements of Iran's nuclear program continued to be subject to IAEA monitoring and safeguards as well, including the construction of the heavy water facility in Arak, the construction and use of hot cells associated with the Tehran Research Reactor, the uranium conversion efforts, and the Russian nuclear fuel delivered for the Bushehr reactor. The report stated that the IAEA had requested, as a voluntary ""transparency measure"", to be allowed access to centrifuge manufacturing sites, but that Iran had refused the request. The IAEA report stated that Iran had also submitted replies to questions regarding ""possible military dimensions"" to its nuclear program, which include ""alleged studies"" on a so-called Green Salt Project, high-explosive testing and missile re-entry vehicles. According to the report, Iran's answers were still under review by the IAEA at the time the report was published. However, as part of its earlier ""overall assessment"" of the allegations, Iran had responded that the documents making the allegations were forged, not authentic, or referred to conventional applications. The report stated that Iran may have more information on the alleged studies, which ""remain a matter of serious concern"", but that the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components. The IAEA also stated that it was not itself in possession of certain documents containing the allegations against Iran, and so was not able to share the documents with Iran. According to 15 September 2008, IAEA report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran, Iran continued to provide the IAEA with access to declared nuclear material and activities, which continued to be operated under safeguards and with no evidence of any diversion of nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. Nevertheless, the report reiterated that the IAEA would not be able to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program unless Iran adopted ""transparency measures"" which exceeded its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, since the IAEA does not verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in any country unless the Additional Protocol is in force. With respect to the report, IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei stated that, ""We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran's enrichment programme"" with the exception of a single issue, ""and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past."" According to the report, Iran had increased the number of operating centrifuges at its Fuel Enrichment Plant in Isfahan, and continued to enrich uranium. Contrary to some media reports which claimed that Iran had diverted uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for a renewed nuclear weapons program, the IAEA emphasized that all of the uranium hexafluoride was under IAEA safeguards. This was re-iterated by IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming, who characterized the report of missing nuclear material in Iran as being ""fictitious."" Iran was also asked to clarify information about foreign assistance it may have received in connection with a high explosive charge suitable for an implosion type nuclear device. Iran stated that there had been no such activities in Iran. The IAEA also reported that it had held a series of meetings with Iranian officials to resolve the outstanding issues including the ""alleged studies"" into nuclear weaponization which were listed in the May 2008 IAEA report. During the course of these meetings, the Iranians filed a series of written responses including a 117-page presentation which confirmed the partial veracity of some of the allegations, but which asserted that the allegations as a whole were based on ""forged"" documents and ""fabricated"" data, and that Iran had not actually received the documentation substantiating the allegations. According to the August 2007 ""Modalities Agreement"" between Iran and the IAEA, Iran had agreed to review and assess the ""alleged studies"" claims, as good faith gesture, ""upon receiving all related documents."" Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh, accused the United States of preventing the IAEA from delivering the documents about the alleged studies to Iran as required by the Modalities Agreement, and stated that Iran had done its best to respond to the allegations but would not accept ""any request beyond our legal obligation and particularly beyond the Work Plan, which we have already implemented."" While once again expressing ""regret"" that the IAEA was not able to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, the report also urged Iran to provide the IAEA with ""substantive information to support its statements and provide access to relevant documentation and individuals"" regarding the alleged studies, as a ""matter of transparency"". The IAEA submitted a number of proposals to Iran to help resolve the allegations and expressed a willingness to discuss modalities that could enable Iran to demonstrate credibly that the activities referred to in the documentation were not nuclear-related, as Iran asserted, while protecting sensitive information related to its conventional military activities. The report does not indicate whether Iran accepted or rejected these proposals. The report also reiterated that IAEA inspectors had found ""no evidence on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon or of certain other key components, such as initiators, or on related nuclear physics studies ... Nor has the Agency detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies"" but insisted that the IAEA would not be able to formally verify the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program unless Iran had agreed to adopt the requested ""transparency measures."" In a 19 February 2009, report to the Board of Governors, IAEA Director General ElBaradei reported that Iran continued to enrich uranium contrary to the decisions of the Security Council and had produced over a ton of low enriched uranium. Results of environmental samples taken by the Agency at the FEP and PFEP5 indicated that the plants have been operating at levels declared by Tehran, ""within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput."" The Agency was also able to confirm there was no ongoing reprocessing related activities at Iran's Tehran Research Reactor and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility. According to the report, Iran also continued to refuse to provide design information or access to verify design information for its IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Iran and the IAEA in February 2003 agreed to modify a provision in the Subsidiary Arrangement to its safeguards agreement (Code 3.1) to require such access. Iran told the Agency in March 2007 that it ""suspended"" the implementation of the modified Code 3.1, which had been ""accepted in 2003, but not yet ratified by the parliament"", and that it would ""revert"" to the implementation of the 1976 version of Code 3.1. The subsidiary arrangement may only be modified by mutual agreement. Iran says that since the reactor is not in a position to receive nuclear material the IAEA's request for access was not justified, and requested that the IAEA not schedule an inspection to verify design information. The Agency says its right to verify design information provided to it is a ""continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility."" Regarding the ""alleged studies"" into nuclear weaponization, the Agency said that ""as a result of the continued lack of cooperation by Iran in connection with the remaining issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency has not made any substantive progress on these issues."" The Agency called on member states which had provided information about the alleged programs to allow the information to be shared with Iran. The Agency said Iran's continued refusal to implement the Additional Protocol was contrary to the request of the Board of Governors and the Security Council. The Agency was able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. Iran says that for the six years the Agency has been considering its case, the IAEA has not found any evidence to prove that Tehran is seeking a nuclear weapon. Regarding the IAEA report, several news reports suggested that Iran had failed to properly report the amount of low-enriched uranium it possessed because Iranian estimates did not match the IAEA inspector's findings, and that Iran now had enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The reporting was widely criticized as unjustifiably provocative and hyped. In response to the controversy, IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming asserted that the IAEA had no reason at all to believe that the estimates of low-enriched uranium produced by Iran were an intentional error, and that no nuclear material could be removed from the facility for further enrichment to make nuclear weapons without the agency's knowledge since the facility is subject to video surveillance and the nuclear material is kept under seal. Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh, Iran's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the February report failed to ""provide any new insight into Iran's nuclear program."" He asserted the report was written in a way which clearly causes misunderstanding in public opinion. He suggested the reports should be written to have a section about whether Iran has fulfilled its NPT obligations and a separate section for whether ""fulfillment of Additional Protocol or sub-arrangements 1 and 3 are beyond the commitment or not."" In a February 2009 press interview, IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei said Iran has low enriched uranium, but ""that doesn't mean that they are going tomorrow to have nuclear weapons, because as long as they are under IAEA verification, as long as they are not weaponizing, you know."" ElBaradei continued that there is a confidence deficit with Iran, but that the concern should not be hyped and that ""many other countries are enriching uranium without the world making any fuss about it."" In February 2009 IAEA Director General reportedly said that he believed the possibility of a military attack on Iran's nuclear installations had been ruled out. ""Force can only be used as a last option ... when all other political possibilities have been exhausted,"" he told Radio France International. Former Director General Hans Blix criticized Western governments for the years lost by their ""ineffective approaches"" to Iran's nuclear program. Blix suggested the West offer ""guarantees against attacks from the outside and subversive activities inside"" and also suggested U.S. involvement in regional diplomacy ""would offer Iran a greater incentive to reach a nuclear agreement than the Bush team's statements that 'Iran must behave itself'."" In July 2009, Yukiya Amano, the in-coming head of the IAEA said: ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents"" that Iran is trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. In September 2009, IAEA Director General Mohamed El Baradei that Iran had broken the law by not disclosing its second uranium enrichment site at Qom sooner. Nevertheless, he said, the United Nations did not have credible evidence that Iran had an operational nuclear program. In November 2009, the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors overwhelmingly backed a demand of the U.S., Russia, China, and three other powers that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment. Iranian officials shrugged off approval of the resolution by 25 members of the Board, but the U.S. and its allies hinted at new UN sanctions if Iran remained defiant. In February 2010, the IAEA issued a report scolding Iran for failing to explain purchases of sensitive technology as well as secret tests of high-precision detonators and modified designs of missile cones to accommodate larger payloads. Such experiments are closely associated with atomic warheads. In May 2010, the IAEA issued a report that Iran had declared production of over 2.5 metric tons of low-enriched uranium, which would be enough if further enriched to make two nuclear weapons, and that Iran has refused to answer inspectors’ questions on a variety of activities, including what the agency called the ""possible military dimensions"" of Iran's nuclear program. In July 2010, Iran barred two IAEA inspectors from entering the country. The IAEA rejected Iran's reasons for the ban and said it fully supported the inspectors, which Tehran has accused of reporting wrongly that some nuclear equipment was missing. In August 2010, the IAEA said Iran has started using a second set of 164 centrifuges linked in a cascade, or string of machines, to enrich uranium to up to 20% at its Natanz pilot fuel enrichment plan. In November 2011 the IAEA released a report stating inspectors had found credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano said evidence gathered by the agency ""indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device."" A number of Western nuclear experts stated there was very little new in the report, and that media reports had exaggerated its significance. Iran charged that the report was unprofessional and unbalanced, and had been prepared with undue political influence primarily by the United States. In November 2011, IAEA officials identified a ""large explosive containment vessel"" inside Parchin. The IAEA later assessed that Iran has been conducting experiments to develop nuclear weapons capability. The IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution by a vote of 32–2 that expressed ""deep and increasing concern"" over the possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program and calling it ""essential"" that Iran provide additional information and access to the IAEA. The United States welcomed the resolution and said it would step up sanctions to press Iran to change course. In response to the IAEA resolution, Iran threatened to reduce its cooperation with the IAEA, though Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi played down talk of withdrawal from the NPT or the IAEA. On 24 February 2012, IAEA Director General Amano reported to the IAEA Board of Governors that high-level IAEA delegations had met twice with Iranian officials to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues, but that major differences remained and Iran did not grant IAEA requests for access to the Parchin site, where the IAEA believes high-explosives research pertinent to nuclear weapons may have taken place. Iran dismissed the IAEA's report on the possible military dimensions to its nuclear program as based on ""unfounded allegations."" Amano called on Iran to agree to a structure approach, based on IAEA verification practices, to resolve outstanding issues. In March 2012, Iran said it would allow another inspection at Parchin ""when an agreement is made on a modality plan."" Not long after, it was reported that Iran might not consent to unfettered access. An ISIS study of satellite imagery claimed to have identified an explosive site at Parchin. The February IAEA report also described progress in Iran's enrichment and fuel fabrication efforts, including a tripling of the number of cascades enriching uranium to nearly 20% and testing of fuel elements for the Tehran Research Reactor and the still incomplete IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Though Iran was continuing to install thousands of additional centrifuges, these were based on an erratic and outdated design, both in its main enrichment plant at Natanz and in a smaller facility at Fordow buried deep underground. ""It appears that they are still struggling with the advanced centrifuges,"" said Olli Heinonen, a former chief nuclear inspector for the Vienna-based U.N. agency, while nuclear expert Mark Fitzpatrick pointed out that Iran had been working on ""second-generation models for over ten years now and still can't put them into large-scale operation"". Peter Crail and Daryl G. Kimball of the Arms Control Organisation commented that the report ""does not identify any breakthroughs"" and ""confirms initial impressions that Iran's announcements last week on a series of 'nuclear advances' were hyped."" In May 2012, the IAEA reported that Iran had increased its rate of production of low-enriched uranium enriched to 3.5% and to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched to 19.75%, but was having difficulty with more advanced centrifuges. The IAEA also reported detecting particles of uranium enriched to 27% at the Fordu enrichment facility. However, a diplomat in Vienna cautioned that the spike in uranium purity found by inspectors could turn out to be accidental. This change drastically moved Iran's uranium toward bomb-grade material. Until now, the highest level of purity that had been found in Iran was 20 percent. In late August, the IAEA set up an Iran Task Force to deal with inspections and other issues related to Iran's nuclear program, in an attempt to focus and streamline the IAEA's handling of Iran's nuclear program by concentrating experts and other resources into one dedicated team. On 30 August, the IAEA released a report showing a major expansion of Iranian enrichment activities. The report said that Iran has more than doubled the number of centrifuges at the underground facility at Fordow, from 1,064 centrifuges in May to 2,140 centrifuges in August, though the number of operating centrifuges had not increased. The report said that since 2010 Iran had produced about 190 kg of 20%-enriched uranium, up from 145 kg in May. The report also noted that Iran had converted some of the 20%-enriched uranium to an oxide form and fabricated into fuel for use in research reactors, and that once this conversion and fabrication have taken place, the fuel cannot be readily enriched to weapon-grade purity. The report also expressed concerns over Parchin, which the IAEA has sought to inspect for evidence of nuclear weapons development. Since the IAEA requested access, ""significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location,"" five buildings had been demolished, while power lines, fences, and paved roads were removed, all of which would hamper the IAEA investigation if it were granted access. In a briefing to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a ""nuclear clean-up."" These images showed a building at Parchin covered in what appeared to be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would ""significantly hamper"" its investigation. A senior Western diplomat described the presentation as ""pretty compelling."" The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said that the purpose of the pink tarpaulin could be to hide further ""clean-up work"" from satellites. However, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, denied the contents of the presentation, saying that ""merely having a photo from up there, a satellite imagery ... this is not the way the agency should do its professional job."" According to the Associated Press, the IAEA received ""new and significant intelligence"" by September 2012, which four diplomats confirmed was the basis for a passage in the August 2012 IAEA report that ""the agency has obtained more information which further corroborates"" suspicions. The intelligence reportedly indicates that Iran had advanced work on computer modeling of the performance of a nuclear warhead, work David Albright of ISIS said was ""critical to the development of a nuclear weapon."" The intelligence would also boost fears by the IAEA that Iran has advanced its weapons research on multiple fronts, as computer modeling is usually accompanied by physical tests of the components which would enter a nuclear weapon. In response to this report, the IAEA Board of Governors on 13 September passed a resolution that rebuked Iran for defying UN Security Council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment and called on Iran to allow inspections of evidence that it is pursuing weapons technology. The resolution, which passed by a vote of 31–1 with 3 abstentions, also expressed ""serious concerns"" about Iran's nuclear program while desiring a peaceful resolution. Senior United States diplomat Robert Wood blamed Iran for ""systematically demolishing"" a facility at the Parchin military base, which IAEA inspectors have attempted to visit in the past, but were not granted access, saying ""Iran has been taking measures that appear consistent with an effort to remove evidence of its past activities at Parchin."" The resolution was introduced jointly by China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. On 16 November, the IAEA released a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities. At Fordow, all 2784 IR-1 centrifuges (16 cascades of 174 each) have been installed, though only 4 cascades are operating and another 4 are fully equipped, vacuum-tested, and ready to begin operating. Iran has produced approximately 233 kg of near-20% enriched uranium, an increase of 43 kg since the August 2012 IAEA report. The IAEA August 2012 report stated that Iran had begun to use 96 kg of its near-20% enriched uranium to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which makes it more difficult to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to uranium hexafluoride gas. Though more of this uranium has been fabricated into fuel, no additional uranium has been sent to the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant at Esfahan. The November report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at Parchin. Citing evidence from satellite imagery that ""Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments"" relevant to nuclear weapons development, the report expresses concern that changes taking place at the Parchin military site might eliminate evidence of past nuclear activities, noting that there had been virtually no activity at that location between February 2005 and the time the IAEA requested access. Those changes include: Iran said that the IR-40 heavy water-moderated research reactor at Arak was expected begin to operate in the first quarter of 2014. During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was continuing. On 21 February, the IAEA released a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities. As of 19 February, 12,699 IR-1 centrifuges have been installed at Natanz. This includes the installation of 2,255 centrifuges since the previous IAEA report in November. Fordow, the nuclear facility near Qom, contains 16 cascades, equally divided between Unit 1 and Unit 2, with a total of 2,710 centrifuges. Iran is continuing to operate the four cascades of 174 IR-1 centrifuges each in two tandem sets to produce 19.75% LEU in a total of 696 enriching centrifuges, the same number of centrifuges enriching as was reported in November 2012. Iran has produced approximately 280 kg of near-20% enriched uranium, an increase of 47 kg since the November 2012 IAEA report and the total 3.5% LEU production stands at 8,271 kg (compared to 7,611 kg reported during the last quarter). The IAEA February 2013 report stated that Iran has resumed reconverting near-20% enriched uranium into Oxide form to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which makes it more difficult to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to uranium hexafluoride gas. The February report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at Parchin. Citing evidence from satellite imagery that ""Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments"". Such installation could be an indicator of nuclear weapons development. The report expresses concern that changes taking place at the Parchin military site might eliminate evidence of past nuclear activities, noting that there had been virtually no activity at that location between February 2005 and the time the IAEA requested access. Those changes include: Iran said that the IR-40 heavy water-moderated research reactor at Arak was expected begin to operate in the first quarter of 2014. During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the previously reported installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was almost complete. The IAEA reports that Iran will use the TRR to test fuel for the IR-40 reactor, a reactor that the UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop building because it could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The IAEA report states that ""on 26 November 2012, the Agency verified a prototype IR-40 natural uranium fuel assembly before its transfer to TRR for irradiation testing."" Since its last visit on 17 August 2011, the Agency has not been provided with further access to the plant so is relying on satellite imagery to monitor the status of the plant. In March 2015, IAEA Director General Amano reported that Iran did not provide sufficient access or information to resolve a dozen issues related to the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, giving only very limited information on only one of those issues. In December 2015, the IAEA issued a report concluding: Following this report, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution closing its consideration of the issues in the report and terminating previous resolutions about Iran. Interviews and surveys show that the majority of Iranians in all groups favor their country's nuclear program. Polls in 2008 showed that the vast majority of Iranians want their country to develop nuclear energy, and 90% of Iranians believe it is important (including 81% very important) for Iran ""to have a full fuel cycle nuclear program."" Though Iranians are not Arab, Arab publics in six countries also believe that Iran has the right to its nuclear program and should not be pressured to stop that program. A poll in September 2010 by the International Peace Institute found that 71 percent of Iranians favored the development of nuclear weapons, a drastic hike over the previous polls by the same agency. However, in July 2012, a poll on an Iranian state-run media outlet found that 2/3 Iranians support suspending uranium enrichment in return for a gradual easing of sanctions. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born commentator with the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company, stated that while Iranians may want nuclear energy, they don't want it at the price the government is willing to pay. In explaining why it had left its enrichment program undeclared to the IAEA, Iran said that for the past twenty-four years it has ""been subject to the most severe series of sanctions and export restrictions on material and technology for peaceful nuclear technology,"" so that some elements of its program had to be done discreetly. Iran said the U.S. intention ""is nothing but to make this deprivation"" of Iran's inalienable right to enrichment technology ""final and eternal,"" and that the United States is completely silent on Israel's nuclear enrichment and weapons program. Iran began its nuclear research as early as 1975, when France cooperated with Iran to set up the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTC) to provide training for personnel to develop certain nuclear fuel cycle capabilities. Iran did not hide other elements of its nuclear program. For example, its efforts at mining and converting uranium were announced on national radio, and Iran also says that in consultation with the Agency and member states throughout the 1990s it underlined its plans to acquire, for exclusively peaceful purposes, fuel enrichment technology. Iran's contracts with other nations to obtain nuclear reactors were also known to the IAEA – but support for the contracts was withdrawn after ""a U.S. special national intelligence estimate declared that while 'Iran's much publicized nuclear power intentions are entirely in the planning stage,' the ambitions of the shah could lead Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, especially in the shadow of India's successful nuclear test in May 1974"". In 2003, the IAEA reported that Iran had failed to meet its obligations to report some of its enrichment activities, which Iran says began in 1985, to the IAEA as required by its safeguards agreement. The IAEA further reported that Iran had undertaken to submit the required information for agency verification and ""to implement a policy of co-operation and full transparency"" as corrective actions. The Iranian government has repeatedly made compromise offers to place strict limits on its nuclear program beyond what the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Additional Protocol legally require of Iran, in order to ensure that the program cannot be secretly diverted to the manufacture of weapons. These offers include operating Iran's nuclear program as an international consortium, with the full participation of foreign governments. This offer by the Iranians matched a proposed solution put forth by an IAEA expert committee that was investigating the risk that civilian nuclear technologies could be used to make bombs. Iran has also offered to renounce plutonium extraction technology, thus ensuring that its heavy water reactor at Arak cannot be used to make bombs either. More recently, the Iranians have reportedly also offered to operate uranium centrifuges that automatically self-destruct if they are used to enrich uranium beyond what is required for civilian purposes. However, despite offers of nuclear cooperation by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran has refused to suspend its enrichment program as the Council has demanded. Iran's representative asserted that dealing with the issue in the Security Council was unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility because its peaceful nuclear program posed no threat to international peace and security, and, that it ran counter to the views of the majority of United Nations Member States, which the Council was obliged to represent. ""They should know that the Iranian nation will not yield to pressure and will not let its rights be trampled on,"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a crowd 31 August 2006, in a televised speech in the northwestern Iranian city of Orumiyeh. In front of his strongest supporters in one of his provincial power bases, the Iranian leader attacked what he called ""intimidation"" by the United Nations, which he said was led by the United States. Ahmadinejad criticised a White House rebuff of his offer for a televised debate with President Bush. ""They say they support dialog and the free flow of information,"" he said. ""But when debate was proposed, they avoided and opposed it."" Ahmadinejad said that sanctions ""cannot dissuade Iranians from their decision to make progress,"" according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. ""On the contrary, many of our successes, including access to the nuclear fuel cycle and producing of heavy water, have been achieved under sanctions."" Iran insists enrichment activities are intended for peaceful purposes, but much of the West, including the United States, allege that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, or a nuclear weapons ""capability"". 31 August 2006, deadline called for Iran to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and suspend its enrichment-related activities or face the possibility of economic sanctions. The United States believes the council will agree to implement sanctions when high-level ministers reconvene in mid-September, U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said. ""We're sure going to work toward that  with a great deal of energy and determination because this cannot go unanswered,"" Burns said. ""The Iranians are obviously proceeding with their nuclear research; they are doing things that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not want them to do, the Security Council doesn't want them to do. There has to be an international answer, and we believe there will be one."" Iran asserts that there is no legal basis for Iran's referral to the United Nations Security Council since the IAEA has not proven that previously undeclared activities had a relationship to a weapons program, and that all nuclear material in Iran (including material that may not have been declared) had been accounted for and had not been diverted to military purposes. Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute requires a report to the UN Security Council for any safeguards noncompliance. The IAEA Board of Governors, in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions, decided that ""Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply with its NPT Safeguards Agreement"" as reported by the IAEA in November 2003 constituted ""non-compliance"" under the terms of Article XII.C of IAEA Statute. Iran also minimizes the significance of the IAEA's inability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, arguing the IAEA has only drawn such conclusions in a subset of states that have ratified and implemented the Additional Protocol. The IAEA has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but not the absence of undeclared activities. According to the IAEA's Safeguards Statement for 2007, of the 82 states where both NPT safeguards and an Additional Protocol are implemented, the IAEA had found no indication of undeclared nuclear activity in 47 states, while evaluations of possible undeclared nuclear activity remained ongoing in 35 states. Iran ceased implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond that required under its safeguards agreement after the IAEA Board of Governors decided to report its safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. Iran insisted that such cooperation had been ""voluntary,"" but on 26 December 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which among other things required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, ""beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol."" The IAEA reported on 19 November 2008, that, while it is ""able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran,"" it ""has not been able to make substantive progress"" on ""key remaining issues of serious concern"" because of a ""lack of cooperation by Iran."" Iran has maintained that the Security Council's engagement in ""the issue of the peaceful nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran"" are unlawful and malicious. Iran also argues that the UN Security Council resolutions demanding a suspension of enrichment constitute a violation of Article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which recognizes the inalienable right of signatory nations to nuclear technology ""for peaceful purposes."" Iran agreed to implement the Additional Protocol under the terms of the October 2003 Tehran agreement and its successor, the November 2004 Paris agreement, and did so for two years before withdrawing from the Paris agreement in early 2006 following the breakdown of negotiations with the EU-3. Since then, Iran has offered not only to ratify the Additional Protocol, but to implement transparency measures on its nuclear program that exceed the Additional Protocol, as long as its right to operate an enrichment program is recognized. The UN Security Council, however, insists that Iran must suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and the United States explicitly ruled out the possibility that it would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection. On 9 April 2007, Iran announced that it has begun enriching uranium with 3 000 centrifuges, presumably at Natanz enrichment site. ""With great honor, I declare that as of today our dear country has joined the nuclear club of nations and can produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale"", said Ahmadinejad. On 22 April 2007, Iranians foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini announced that his country rules out enrichment suspension ahead of talks with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on 25 April 2007. In March 2009 Iran announced plans to open the Bushehr nuclear power plant to tourism as a way to highlight their peaceful nuclear intentions. Reacting to the November 2009 IAEA Board of Governors resolution demanding that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast described the resolution as a ""show ... aimed at putting pressure on Iran, which will be useless."" The Iranian government subsequently authorized the country's Atomic Energy Organization to begin building ten more uranium-enrichment plants for enhancing the country's electricity production. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 1 December brushed aside the threat of UN sanctions over his country's failure to accept a UN-proposed deal on its nuclear program, stating that such a move by western nations would not hinder Iran's nuclear program. Ahmadinejad told state television that he believed further negotiations with world powers over his country's nuclear program were not needed, describing warnings by Western powers that Iran would be isolated if it fails to accept the UN-proposed deal as ""ridiculous."" Watched by senior officials from Iran and Russia, Iran began fueling Bushehr I on 21 August 2010 the nation's state media reported, in an effort to help create nuclear-generated electricity. While state media reported it will take about two months for the reactor to begin generating electricity, Russia's nuclear agency says it will take longer. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, recently asserted Iran's right to establish nuclear plants. On 17 September 2012, speaking at the IAEA General Conference, Iranian nuclear chief Fereydoun Abbasi attacked the IAEA, saying that ""terrorists and saboteurs"" had possibly infiltrated the IAEA in order to derail Iran's nuclear program. Abbasi said that on 17 August 2012, an underground enrichment plant was sabotaged, and IAEA inspectors arrived in Iran to inspect it soon after. The Associated Press noted that his comments reflected a determination in Iran to continue defying international pressure regarding its nuclear program. Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said that Iran's accusations regarding the IAEA ""are a new low. Increasingly cornered, they are lashing out wildly."" Abassi's allegations were viewed by some Western experts as providing a potential pretext for Iran to officially downgrade its level of cooperation with the IAEA. Abbasi also met separately with IAEA Director General Amano, after which the IAEA pressed Iran to address concerns in its nuclear program, and said that the IAEA was ready for negotiations soon. The IAEA did not comment on Abbasi's statements regarding ""terrorists and saboteurs,"" but did say that it was vital that Iran cooperate with IAEA inspectors in order to clarify suspicions regarding its nuclear program. In an interview on the sidelines of the IAEA General Conference. Abbasi was quoted as saying that Iran had intentionally provided false information about its nuclear program to mislead western intelligence. Abbasi, who had been an assassination target in 2010, said Iran sometimes exaggerated and sometimes understated its progress. Iran planned to showcase its nuclear exports at Atomexpo 2013. In September 2013, in an interview with the Washington Post, the newly elected President of Iran Hassan Rouhani said that he wanted a resolution to the nuclear issue within ""months, not years."" Rouhani said he saw the nuclear issue as a ""beginning point"" for U.S.-Iran relations. President George W. Bush insisted on 31 August 2006, that ""there must be consequences"" for Iran's defiance of demands that it stop enriching uranium. He asserted ""the world now faces a grave threat from the radical regime in Iran. The Iranian regime arms, funds, and advises Hezbollah."" The IAEA issued a report saying Iran had not suspended its uranium enrichment activities, a United Nations official said. This report opened the way for UN Security Council sanctions against Iran. Facing a Security Council deadline to stop its uranium enrichment activities, Iran has left little doubt it will defy the West and continue its nuclear program. A congressional report released on 23 August 2006, summarized the documentary history of Iran's nuclear program, but also made allegations against the IAEA. The IAEA responded with a strongly worded letter to then U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Peter Hoekstra, which labeled as ""outrageous and dishonest"" the report's allegation that an IAEA inspector was dismissed for violating a supposed IAEA policy against ""telling the whole truth"" about Iran and pointed out other factual errors, such as a claim that Iran had enriched ""weapons-grade"" uranium. John Bolton, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on 31 August 2006, said that he expected action to impose sanctions to begin immediately after the deadline passes, with meetings of high-level officials in the coming days, followed by negotiations on the language of the sanctions resolution. Bolton said that when the deadline passes ""a little flag will go up."" ""In terms of what happens afterward, at that point, if they have not suspended all uranium enrichment activities, they will not be in compliance with the resolution,"" he said. ""And at that point, the steps that the foreign ministers have agreed upon previously ... we would begin to talk about how to implement those steps."" The five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, previously offered Iran a package of incentives aimed at getting the country to restart negotiations, but Iran refused to halt its nuclear activities first. Incentives included offers to improve Iran's access to the international economy through participation in groups such as the World Trade Organization and to modernize its telecommunications industry. The incentives also mentioned the possibility of lifting restrictions on U.S. and European manufacturers wanting to export civil aircraft to Iran. And a proposed long-term agreement accompanying the incentives offered a ""fresh start in negotiations."" In a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the United States Intelligence Community assessed that Iran had ended all ""nuclear weapon design and weaponization work"" in 2003. IAEA officials complained in 2007 that most U.S. intelligence shared with it to date about Iran's nuclear program proved to be inaccurate, and that none had led to significant discoveries inside Iran through that time. Through 2008, the United States repeatedly refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in an attack on Iran. The U.S. Nuclear Posture Review made public in 2002 specifically envisioned the use of nuclear weapons on a first strike basis, even against non-nuclear armed states. Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that, according to military officials, the Bush administration had plans for the use of nuclear weapons against ""underground Iranian nuclear facilities"". When specifically questioned about the potential use of nuclear weapons against Iran, President Bush claimed that ""All options were on the table"". According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist, Bush ""directly threatened Iran with a preemptive nuclear strike. It is hard to read his reply in any other way."" The Iranian authorities consistently replied that they were not seeking nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the United States, and instead emphasize the creation of a nuclear-arms free zone in the Middle East. The policy of using nuclear weapons on a first-strike basis against non-nuclear opponents is a violation of the US Negative Security Assurance pledge not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear members of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) such as Iran. Threats of the use of nuclear weapons against another country constitute a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 984 and the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. In December 2008, President-Elect Barack Obama gave an interview on Sunday's ""Meet the Press"" with host Tom Brokaw during which he said the United States needs to ""ratchet up tough but direct diplomacy with Iran"". He said in his view the United States needs to make it clear to the Iranians that their alleged development of nuclear weapons and funding of organizations ""like Hamas and Hezbollah,"" and threats against Israel are ""unacceptable."" Obama supports diplomacy with Iran without preconditions ""to pressure Iran to stop their illicit nuclear program"". Mohamed ElBaradei has welcomed the new stance to talk to Iran as ""long overdue"". Iran said Obama should apologize for the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II and his administration should stop talking to the world and ""listen to what others are saying."" In his first press interview as President, Obama told Al Arabiya that ""if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us."" In March 2009 U.S. National Intelligence Director Dennis C. Blair and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples told a United States Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing that Iran has only low-enriched uranium, which there were no indications it was refining. Their comments countered ones made earlier by an Israeli general and Maples said the United States was arriving at different conclusions from the same facts. On 7 April 2009, a Manhattan district attorney charged a financier with the suspected misuse of Manhattan banks employed to transfer money between China and Iran by way of Europe and the United States. The materials in question can be used for weapons as well as civilian purposes, but some of the material can potentially be used in making engine nozzles that can withstand fiery temperatures and centrifuges that can enrich uranium into atomic fuel. The charges would carry a maximum of up to a year in jail for fifth-degree conspiracy and a maximum of four years for falsifying business records. David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert who assisted in the prosecution, said that it is impossible to say how Iran used or could use the raw materials it acquired. A document released by the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research in August 2009 assessed that Iran was unlikely to have the technical capability to produce HEU (highly enriched uranium) before 2013, and the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence that Iran had yet made the decision to produce highly enriched uranium. In 2009, U.S. intelligence assessed that Iranian intentions were unknown. On 26 July 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton explicitly ruled out the possibility that the Obama administration would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection. Following the November 2009 IAEA Board of Governors resolution demanding Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs avoided mentioning sanctions but indicated harsher measures were possible unless Iran compromised: ""If Iran refuses to meet its obligations, then it will be responsible for its own growing isolation and the consequences."" Glyn Davies, the chief U.S. delegate to the IAEA, told reporters: ""Six nations ... for the first time came together ... have put together this resolution we all agreed on. That's a significant development."" A 2009 U.S. congressional research paper said that U.S. intelligence believed Iran ended ""nuclear weapon design and weaponization work"" in 2003. Some advisors within the Obama administration reaffirmed the intelligence conclusions, while other ""top advisers"" in the Obama administration ""say they no longer believe"" the key finding of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. Thomas Fingar, former Chairman of the National Intelligence Council until December 2008, said that the original 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ""became contentious, in part, because the White House instructed the Intelligence Community to release an unclassified version of the report's key judgments but declined to take responsibility for ordering its release."" A National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the most authoritative written judgment concerning a national security issue prepared by the Director of Central Intelligence. The impending opening of the Bushehr I plant in late 2010 prompted the White House to question why Iran is continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. ""Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in August. ""It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program,"" he said. On 8 January 2012, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said on Face the Nation that Iran was not trying to develop a nuclear weapon, but was trying to develop a nuclear capability. He also urged Israel to work together rather than make a unilateral strike on Iran’s nuclear installations. On 1 August 2012, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while in Israel said that the United States had ""options,"" including military options, to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, should diplomacy fail. In 2012, sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. The senior officers of all of the major American intelligence agencies stated that there was no conclusive evidence that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003. On 14 January 2013, the Institute for Science and International Security (a U.S. think tank) published an 154-page report by five U.S. experts titled ""U.S. Nonproliferation Strategy for the Changing Middle East,"" which stated that Iran could produce enough weapon-grade uranium for one or more nuclear bombs by the middle of 2014. Therefore, the report recommended that the United States should increase sanctions on Iran in order to curb its ability to develop weapon-grade uranium. In addition the report states: ""The president should explicitly declare that he will use military force to destroy Iran's nuclear program if Iran takes additional decisive steps toward producing a bomb."" On 2 February 2013, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama Administration ""would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we were doing that. We would let our partners know if that occasion presented itself. That offer stands, but it must be real and tangible, and there has to be an agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise."" A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: ""The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table."" On 4 February the Italian news-wire ""Agenzia Nova"", citing ""sources in Teheran,"" reported that ""from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States"" to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that U.S. diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions. On 2 April 2015, hailing the agreement between the P5+1 and Iran on parameters for a comprehensive agreement, President Obama said ""Today, the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached an historic understanding with Iran, which if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Iran has held a series of meetings with a group of six countries: China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, United States. These six are known as the P5+1 (the permanent five members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or alternatively as the E3+3. These meetings are intended to resolve concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 were resumed on 21 January 2011 in Istanbul after about a 14-month break. The two-day meetings were led by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. The talks deadlocked after Iran imposed two preconditions: recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium and dropping the United Nations economic sanctions on Tehran. The first session of fresh negotiations in April went well, with delegates praising the constructive dialogue and Iran's positive attitude. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said, however, that Iran had been given a ""freebie"", a charge that was sharply rebutted by Barack Obama. In the lead up to the second round of negotiations in May, and in what may foreshadow a significant concession, an unnamed senior U.S. official hinted the United States might accept Iran enriching uranium to 5% so long as the Iranians agreed to tough international oversight of the process. The U.S. shift was reportedly made for the pragmatic reason that unconditional demands for zero enrichment would make it impossible to reach a negotiated deal. Netanyahu had insisted a few days before that he would tolerate no enrichment, not even to the 3% required for nuclear power. In a shift on the Iranian side, April saw members of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps urging Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to maintain a policy of keeping uranium enrichment at or below 20%. The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton felt compelled to make a special visit to Netanyahu, partly to keep him from again voicing his negativity and opposition to the negotiations. At the meeting, which included Avigdor Lieberman, Ehud Barak and Shaul Mofaz, the Israelis demanded a guaranteed timetable for cessation of all uranium enrichment by Iran, the removal of all enriched uranium, and the dismantlement of the underground facility at Fordo. Otherwise, they said, Iran would use the talks to buy time. Foreign Ministers of the P5+1 met in September 2013 on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, and were joined by Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif. Lead negotiators for the P5+1 and Iran met in Geneva 15–16 October to discuss elements of a possible framework for resolving questions about Iran's nuclear program. Experts from the P5+1 and Iran met in Vienna 30–31 October to exchange detailed information on those elements. Lead negotiators met again 7–8 November to negotiate that framework, joined at the end by Foreign Ministers from the P5+1, but despite extending the talks past midnight 9 November were unable to agree on that framework and agreed instead to meet again 20 November. On 24 November, the foreign ministers of Iran and the P5+1 agreed to a six-month interim deal that involves the freezing of key parts of the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for a decrease in sanctions, to provide time to negotiate a permanent agreement. Iran will stop enriching uranium beyond 5%, and will stop development of their Arak plant. The UN will be granted greater access for inspections. In exchange, Iran will receive relief from sanctions of approximately US$7 billion (£4.3 billion) and no additional sanctions will be imposed. President Obama called the agreement an ""important first step."" Following further negotiation of implementation details, a summary of which was released by the White House on 16 January 2014, implementation began 20 January 2014. The P5+1 and Iran held meetings at the senior levels 18–20 February and agreed on a framework for future negotiations. Following expert talks, a next round of senior-level talks is scheduled to be held in Vienna starting 17 March 2014. On 20 February 2014 the IAEA reported that Iran was implementing its commitments to the P5+1 and its commitments to the IAEA under the Joint Statement of 11 November 2013. During February to July 2014 the P5+1 and Iran have held high-level negotiations on a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program in Vienna, Austria. After six rounds of talks the parties missed the deadline for reaching a deal and agreed to extend the negotiations through 24 November. Additionally, it was agreed that the U.S. will unblock $2.8 billion in frozen Iranian funds, in exchange for Iran continuing to convert its stocks of 20% enriched uranium into fuel. The EU Court of Justice annulled a freeze of the Iranian Sharif University's assets since the EU could not provide sufficient evidence of the university's links to the nuclear program of Iran. On 21 September 2009, Iran informed the IAEA that it was constructing a second enrichment facility. The following day (22 September) IAEA Director General ElBaradei informed the United States, and two days later (24 September) the United States, United Kingdom and France briefed the IAEA on an enrichment facility under construction at an underground location at Fordu, 42 kilometres (26 mi) north of Qom. On 25 September, at the G-20 Summit, the three countries criticized Iran for once again concealing a nuclear facility from the IAEA. The United States said that the facility, which was still months from completion, was too small to be useful for a civil program but could produce enough high-enriched uranium for one bomb per year. Iran said the plant was for peaceful purposes and would take between a year and a half to two years to complete, and that the notice Iran had given had exceeded the 180 days before insertion of nuclear materials the IAEA safeguards agreement that Iran was following required. Iran agreed to allow IAEA inspections. Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the site was built for maximum protection from aerial attack: carved into a mountain and near a military compound of the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Also in October, the United States, France and Russia proposed a UN-drafted deal to Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and international concerns that Iran harbors a secret intent on developing a nuclear weapon. After some delay in responding, on 29 October, Ahmadinejad voiced an openness towards cooperation with other world powers. ""We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate,"" he said in a live broadcast on state television. However, he added that Iran would not retreat ""one iota"" on its right to a sovereign nuclear program. In November 2009, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution that criticized Iran for defying a UN Security Council ban on uranium enrichment, censured Iran for secretly building a uranium enrichment facility and demanded that it immediately suspend further construction. It noted the IAEA chief Mohammed El-Baradei cannot confirm that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively geared toward peaceful uses, and expressed ""serious concern"" that Iran's stonewalling of an IAEA probe means ""the possibility of military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program"" cannot be excluded. In October 2009 Hugo Chávez announced that Iran was helping Venezuela in uranium exploration. He said that ""We're working with several countries, with Iran, with Russia. We're responsible for what we're doing, we're in control"". A number of reports suggested that Venezuela was helping Iran to obtain uranium and evade international sanctions. On 9 February 2010 the Iranian government announced that it would produce uranium enriched to up to 20% to produce fuel for a research reactor used to produce medical radioisotopes, processing its existing stocks of 3.5% enriched uranium. Two days later during the celebrations in Tehran for the 31st anniversary of the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolution, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran was now a ""nuclear state."" IAEA officials confirmed it has enriched uranium ""up to 19.8%"". Responding to criticism, President Ahmadinejad said, ""Why do they think that 20 per cent is such a big deal? Right now in Natanz we have the capability to enrich at over 20 per cent and at over 80 per cent, but because we don't need it, we won't do it."" He added ""If we wanted to manufacture a bomb, we would announce it."" On the same day as the President's announcement, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters that their 20% enrichment production, was going ""very well,"" adding ""There is no limit on enrichment. We can enrich up to 100% ... But we never had the intention and we do not have the intention to do so, unless we need (to)."" He maintained that the 20% production was for a Tehran medical reactor, and as such would be limited to around 1.5 kg per month. U.S. President Obama reportedly sent a letter dated 20 April 2010 to President Lula of Brazil, in which he outlined a proposal of fuel swap. While expressing skepticism that the Iranians would now be willing to accept such a deal, having provided ""no credible explanation"" for the previous deal's rejection, President Obama wrote ""For us, Iran’s agreement to transfer 1,200 kg of Iran’s low enriched uranium (LEU) out of the country would build confidence and reduce regional tensions by substantially reducing Iran’s LEU stockpile."" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a similar letter. A senior U.S. official told the Washington Post that the letter was a response to Iran's desire to ship out its uranium piecemeal, rather than in a single batch, and that during ""multiple conversations"" U.S. officials made clear that Iran should also cease 20% enrichment; however, the official stated ""there was no president-to-president letter laying out those broader concerns"". On 17 May 2010 Iran, Brazil, and Turkey issued a joint declaration ""in which Iran agreed to send low-enriched uranium to Turkey in return for enriched fuel for a research reactor."" Iran reported the joint declaration to the IAEA on 24 May 2010, asking it to inform the ""Vienna Group"" (the United States, Russia, France, and the IAEA), in order to conclude a written agreement and make contingent arrangements between Iran and the Vienna Group. The proposal was welcomed by Arab leaders and China. France's Prime Minister called the agreement a ""positive step"" toward resolving the Iran nuclear program dispute, if Iran were to cease uranium enrichment altogether. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton played down the agreement, saying it was a step in the right direction but did not go far enough and left questions unanswered. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the proposal had ""a number of deficiencies,"" including Iran's intention to continue enriching uranium to high levels. Meanwhile, the United States was also pursuing other action to address the situation in Iran, in the case that the more diplomatic method not produce a satisfactory deal, and on 18 May 2010, announced a ""draft accord"" among UN permanent Security Council members for additional sanctions on Iran, designed to pressure it to end its nuclear enrichment program. Turkey and Brazil criticized the sanctions proposal. Davutoglu said that the swap agreement showed Iran's ""clear political will"" toward engagement on the nuclear issue. Brazil's Foreign Minister also expressed frustration with the U.S. stance, saying of Brazil's vote against the sanctions resolution: ""We could not have voted in any different way except against."" Early analysis from the BBC stated the swap deal could have been an ""effort by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to deflect pressure for fresh sanctions"" and that ""Iran watchers are already criticising Washington for moving the goal posts"". Iran's atomic energy chief said the agreement left world powers no reason to continue to pressure Iran regarding its nuclear program. Iran also described the agreement as a major boost to trilateral relations with Brazil and Turkey, and Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the continuing call for sanctions, stating that the ""domineering powers headed by America are unhappy with cooperation between independent countries."" Mohamed ElBaradei, former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that ""the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least more than half of the Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a confidence-building measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West  the space to negotiate. I hope that it would be perceived as a win-win situation. If we see what I have been observing in the last couple of days that it is an ""empty dressing"", I think it is a wrong approach...we lost six years of failed policy frankly vis-à-vis Iran. And it's about time now to understand that the Iranian issue is not going to be resolved except, until and unless we sit with the Iranians and try to find a fair and equitable solution."" ""If this deal is followed up with a broader engagement of the IAEA and the international community, it can be a positive step to a negotiated settlement,"" UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. In a January 2012 article in Salon magazine, Glenn Greenwald noted the killing of at least five Iranian nuclear scientists during 2010 and 2011, by unknown attackers, with no apparent outcry in the Western media. According to Iran, and privately confirmed by unnamed U.S. government officials, the attacks on the nuclear scientists and facilities are being carried out by an Iranian dissident group called the People's Mujahedin of Iran. According to U.S. officials, the group is financed, trained, and armed by Mossad. In January 2016, it was announced that Iran had dismantled major parts of its nuclear program, paving the way for sanctions to be lifted. The continuing controversy over Iran's nuclear program revolves in part around allegations of nuclear studies by Iran with possible military applications until 2003, when, according to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the program was ended. The allegations, which include claims that Iran had engaged in high-explosives testing, sought to manufacture ""green salt"" (UF
4) and to design a nuclear-capable missile warhead, were based on information obtained from a laptop computer which was allegedly retrieved from Iran in 2004. The US presented some of the alleged contents of the laptop in 2005 to an audience of international diplomats, though the laptop and the full documents contained in it have yet to be given to the IAEA for independent verification. According to the New York Times: On 21 August 2007, Iran and the IAEA finalized an agreement, titled ""Understandings of The Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on the Modalities of Resolution of the Outstanding Issues,"" that listed outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program and set out a timetable to resolve each issue in order. These unresolved issues included the status of Iran's uranium mine at Gchine, allegations of experiments with plutonium and uranium metal, and the use of Polonium 210. Specifically regarding the ""Alleged Studies"", the Modalities agreement asserted that while Iran considers the documents to be fabricated, Iran would nevertheless address the allegations ""upon receiving all related documents"" as a goodwill gesture. The Modalities Agreement specifically said that aside from the issues identified in the document, there were ""no other remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran's past nuclear program and activities."" The United States was opposed to the Modalities Agreement between Iran and the IAEA, and vehemently objected to it, accusing Iran of ""manipulating"" IAEA. Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director General for safeguards underlined the importance of the Iran-IAEA agreement as a working arrangement on how to resolve the outstanding issues that triggered Security Council resolutions: Following the implementation of the Modalities Agreement, the IAEA issued another report on the status of Iran's nuclear program on 22 February 2008. According to this report, the IAEA had no evidence of a current, undeclared nuclear program in Iran, and all of the remaining issues listed in the Modalities Agreement regarding past undeclared nuclear activities had been resolved, with the exception of the ""Alleged Studies"" issue. Regarding this report, IAEA director ElBaradei specifically stated: The US had made some of the ""Alleged Studies"" documentation available to the IAEA just a week prior to the issuance of the IAEA's February 2008 report on Iran's nuclear program. According to the IAEA report itself, the IAEA had ""not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard."" Some diplomats reportedly dismissed the new allegations as being ""of doubtful value ... relatively insignificant and coming too late."" It was reported on 3 March 2008, that Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director general of safeguards, had briefed diplomats about the contents of the ""Alleged Studies"" documents a week earlier. Reportedly, Heinonen added that the IAEA had obtained corroborating information from the intelligence agencies of several countries, that pointed to sophisticated research into some key technologies needed to build and deliver a nuclear bomb. In April 2008, Iran reportedly agreed to address the sole outstanding issue of the ""Alleged Studies"" However, according to the subsequent May 2008 IAEA report, the IAEA was not able to actually provide these same ""Alleged Studies"" documents to Iran, because the IAEA did not have the documents itself or was not allowed to share them with Iran. For example, in paragraph 21, the IAEA report states: ""Although the Agency had been shown the documents that led it to these conclusions, it was not in possession of the documents and was therefore unfortunately unable to make them available to Iran."" Also, in paragraph 16, the IAEA report states: ""The Agency received much of this information only in electronic form and was not authorised to provide copies to Iran."" The IAEA has requested that it be allowed to share the documents with Iran. Nevertheless, according to the report, Iran may have more information on the alleged studies which ""remain a matter of serious concern"" but the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components. Iran's refusal to respond to the IAEA's questions unless it is given access to the original documents has caused a standoff. In February 2008, the New York Times reported that the U.S. refusal to provide access to those documents was a source of friction between the Bush Administration and then Director General ElBaradei. ElBaradei later noted that these documents could not be shared because of the need to protect sources and methods, but noted that this allowed Iran to question their authenticity. According to Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, ""The government of the United States has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any authenticated document and all it has are forged documents."" The IAEA has requested that third parties allow it to share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. However, questions about the authenticity of the documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the MEK, an Iranian dissident group officially considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional weapons programs. Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents' authenticity. They cite that as a key document in the study had since been proven to have been fraudulently altered, it put in doubt the entire collection. Iran says that its program is solely for peaceful purposes and consistent with the NPT. The IAEA Board of Governors has found Iran in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement, concluding in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions, that Iran's past safeguards ""breaches"" and ""failures"" constituted ""non-compliance"" with its Safeguards Agreement In the decision, the IAEA Board of Governors also concluded that the concerns raised fell within the competence of the UN Security Council. Most experts recognize that non-compliance with an NPT safeguards agreement is not equivalent to a violation of the NPT or does not automatically constitute a violation of the NPT itself. The IAEA does not make determinations regarding compliance with the NPT, and the UN Security Council does not have a responsibility to adjudicate treaty violations. Dr. James Acton, an associate in the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has said the 2010 NPT Review Conference could recognize that non-compliance with safeguards agreements would violate article III of the NPT. Director of the Australian Nonproliferation and Safeguards Organization and then Chairman of IAEA Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation John Carlson wrote in considering the case of Iran that ""formally IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) decisions concern compliance with safeguards agreements, rather than the NPT as such, but in practical terms non-compliance with a safeguards agreement constitutes non-compliance with the NPT."" A September 2009 Congressional Research Service paper said ""whether Iran has violated the NPT is unclear."" A 2005 U.S. State Department report on compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements concluded, based on its analysis of the facts and the relevant international laws, that Iran's extensive failures to make required reports to the IAEA made ""clear that Iran has violated Article III of the NPT and its IAEA safeguards agreement."" Testimony presented to the Foreign Select Committee of the British Parliament drew the opposite conclusion: The 2005 U.S. State Department compliance report also concluded that ""Iran is pursuing an effort to manufacture nuclear weapons, and has sought and received assistance in this effort in violation of Article II of the NPT"". The November 2007 United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) asserted that Tehran halted a nuclear weapons program in fall 2003, but that Iran ""at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapon"". Russian analyst Alexei Arbatov, said ""no hard facts on violation of the NPT per se have been discovered"" and also wrote that ""all this is not enough to accuse Iran of a formal breach of the letter of the NPT"" and ""giving Iran the benefit of the doubt, there is no hard evidence of its full-steam development of a military nuclear program."" NPT Article IV recognizes the right of states to research, develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but only in conformity with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations under Articles I and II of the NPT. The UN Security Council has demanded that Iran suspend its nuclear enrichment activities in multiple resolutions. The United States has said the ""central bargain of the NPT is that if non-nuclear-weapon states renounce the pursuit of nuclear weapons, and comply fully with this commitment, they may gain assistance under Article IV of the Treaty to develop peaceful nuclear programs"". The U.S. has written that Paragraph 1 of Article IV makes clear that access to peaceful nuclear cooperation must be ""in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty"" and also by extension Article III of the NPT. Rahman Bonad, Director of Arms Control Studies at the Center for Strategic Research at Tehran, has argued that demands to cease enrichment run counter to ""all negotiations and discussions that led to the adoption of the NPT in the 1960s and the fundamental logic of striking a balance between the rights and obligations stipulated in the NPT."" In February 2006 Iran's foreign minister insisted that ""Iran rejects all forms of scientific and nuclear apartheid by any world power,"" and asserted that this ""scientific and nuclear apartheid"" was ""an immoral and discriminatory treatment of signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,"" and that Iran has ""the right to a peaceful use of nuclear energy and we cannot accept nuclear apartheid."" Russia has said it believes Iran has a right to enrich uranium on its soil. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested that there could be work toward an international nuclear fuel bank instead of indigenous Iranian enrichment, while Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, has said ""the United States should be willing to discuss what Iran describes as its 'right to enrich' ... provided that Iran accepts both limits on its enrichment program (no HEU) and enhanced safeguards"". Officials of the Iranian government and members of the Iranian public believe Iran should be developing its peaceful nuclear industry. A March 2008 poll of 30 nations found moderate support for allowing Iran to produce nuclear fuel for electricity alongside a full program of UN inspections. The Iranian authorities deny seeking a nuclear weapons capacity for deterrence or retaliation since Iran's level of technological progress cannot match that of existing nuclear weapons states, and the acquisition of nuclear weapons would only spark an arms race in the Middle East. According to Ambassador Javad Zarif: Iran's President Ahmadinejad, during an interview with NBC anchor Brian Willians in July 2008, also dismissed the utility of nuclear weapons as a source of security and stated: And according to Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization: Iran has consistently supported the creation of a nuclear-weapons free zone in the Middle East. In 1974, as concerns in the region grew over Israel's nuclear weapon program, Iran formally proposed the concept of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East in a joint resolution in the UN General Assembly. The Shah of Iran had made a similar appeal five years earlier but had failed to attract any support. The call for the creation of nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East was repeated by Iran's President Ahmadinejad in 2006, by Foreign Minister Mottaki in 2008, and by Foreign Minister Zarif in 2015.  The Iran nuclear deal framework was a preliminary framework agreement reached in 2015 between the Islamic Republic of Iran and a group of world powers: the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China—plus Germany) and the European Union. Negotiations for a framework deal over the nuclear program of Iran took place between the foreign ministers of the countries at a series of meetings held from 26 March to 2 April 2015 in Lausanne, Switzerland. On 2 April the talks came to a conclusion and a press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight nations had reached an agreement on a framework deal. The parties announced that ""Today, we have taken a decisive step: we have reached solutions on key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action."" with a goal of working out this final deal by 30 June 2015. Announcing the framework, Foreign Minister Zarif stated: ""No agreement has been reached so we do not have any obligation yet. Nobody has obligations now other than obligations that we already undertook under the Joint Plan of Action that we adopted in Geneva in November 2013."" The framework deal was embodied in a document published by the EU's European External Action Service titled Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Switzerland. and in a document published by the U.S. Department of State titled Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Program. On 14 July 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and the P5+1 and EU, a comprehensive agreement based on the April 2015 framework, was announced.   According to the joint statement in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran agreed on a framework for a deal. According to this framework, Iran would redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol (with provisional application) in order to lift all nuclear-related economical sanctions, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets. In addition to the joint statement, the United States and Iran issued fact sheets of their own. The joint statement outlines the following: When the IAEA verifies Iran's implementation of its key nuclear commitments: In addition to the final statement, both the United States and Iran have made public more detailed descriptions of their agreement. Officials of both sides acknowledge that they have different narratives on this draft. The U.S. government has published a fact sheet summarizing the main points of the deal. Shortly after it was published, top Iranian officials, including the Iranian supreme leader and the Iranian minister of defense have disputed the document on key points which remain unresolved. On 22 July, Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister who led the negotiations, made an announcement on state-controlled television that the recently reached nuclear deal with the world powers did not include limitations on Iran’s weapons capabilities or missile power and that Tehran would keep arming its regional allies. ""We have told them  in the negotiations that we will supply arms to anyone and anywhere necessary and will import weapons from anywhere we want and we have clarified this during the negotiations,"" Araghchi said. 
In a speech the following Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei added, ""Our policy will not change with regards to the arrogant US government."" According to details of the deal published by the US government, Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300 kg (660 lbs) for 15 years. The level of enrichment must also remain at 3.67%. Iran will retain no more than 6,104 out of almost 20,000 centrifuges it possesses. There are two uranium enrichment facilities in Iran - Natanz and Fordo. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreed on 14 July, the Natanz facility will be limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges for 10 years. At Fordo, no enrichment will be permitted for 15 years, and the underground facility will be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. 1,044 centrifuges at the site will produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. This amount of enrichment - namely 3.67% - would be enough just for peaceful and civil use to power parts of country and therefore is not sufficient for building a nuclear bomb. According to press TV report based on Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran's extra centrifuges and the related infrastructure in the Natanz facility will be collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order to be replaced by new machines consistent with the allowed standards. Iran will be allowed to allocate the current stockpile of enriched materials for the purpose of producing nuclear fuel or swapping it with uranium in the international markets. These comprehensive solutions permit Iran to continue its enrichment program inside its territory and also allowed to continue its production of nuclear fuel for running its nuclear power plants. According to the U.S. State Department fact sheet and a joint statement by Iran and the EU, Iran has agreed to convert its underground Fordo facility into a research centre for nuclear science and physics and about half of the Fordo facility would be dedicated to advanced nuclear research and production of stable radioisotopes which have important applications in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. Furthermore, Iran would maintain no more than 1,044 centrifuges for this purpose. According to Press TV, the implementation of JCPOA followed by lifting of all the UN Security Council sanctions as well as all economic and financial embargoes by the United States and the European Union imposed on Iran's banks, insurance, investment, and all other related services in different fields, including petrochemical, oil, gas and automobile industries will be immediately lifted all at once. However, according to the fact sheet which is published by the U.S. government, U.S. and EU nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified the implementation of the key nuclear-related steps by Iran. Iran will be required to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency access to all of its declared facilities so that the agency can be sure as to the peaceful nature of the nuclear program. According to published details of the deal which is published by the U.S. government, IAEA inspectors would have access to all of the nuclear facilities including enrichment facilities, the supply chain that supports the nuclear program and uranium mines as well as continuous surveillance at uranium mills, centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities. Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country. Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA’s concerns regarding the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program. According to the Iranian fact sheet, Iran will implement the Additional Protocol temporarily and voluntarily in line with its confidence-building measures and after that the protocol will be ratified in a time frame by the Iranian government and parliament (Majlis).  United Nations –Ban Ki-moon the Secretary-General of the United Nations welcomed this agreement. ""A comprehensive, negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue will contribute to peace and stability in the region."" he said.  Yukiya Amano the direct General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the release a manifest welcomed the compromise.""The IAEA welcomes the announcement by E3+3  and Iran on the key parameters for a joint Comprehensive Plan of Action."" Yukiaya Amano said in his manifest.  Iran – Iran's President Hassan Rouhani welcomed the development on Twitter. He said the nuclear agreement is just a step toward interaction with the world and all those countries that want to respect the Iranian nation. One week after Lausanne negotiations, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, explained his idea about the negotiations. He neither accepted nor rejected the framework deal and stated that: ""nothing has happened yet."" About sanctions, he proclaimed all sanctions must be completely lifted on the day when the nuclear deal is signed.  United States – President Barack Obama said a ""historic understanding"" had been reached with Iran, and pointed out that the deal with Iran is a good deal if the deal could meet core objectives of the United States. 150 Democratic Congress members signaled that they support reaching a deal, enough to sustain a Presidential Veto. Majority of Congress including all republicans and some democrats opposed the deal.  Russia – Sergey Lavrov Foreign Minister of Russia knew this agreement a positive point in the security of Middle East.  United Kingdom – Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said that the framework agreement with Iran was well beyond what many thought possible even 18 months earlier.  Germany – German Chancellor Angela Merkel pointed out that the agreement is a great credit to all negotiating partners.  Oman – Omani Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah welcomed the framework deal between the Group 5+1 framework deal with Iran on its nuclear programme describing it ""an historic agreement"".

PDKI - On September 2016, PDKI released a statement that their return to militancy was motivated by Iran's nuclear deal.  "
7,Iran Election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Iran on 26 February 2016 to elect members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly for all seats in the 10th parliamentary election in the Islamic Republic era, and the 35th since the Persian Constitutional Revolution. A second round was held on 29 April 2016 for some constituencies where candidates failed to obtain the required minimum 25 percent of votes cast. The elected MPs will serve from May 28, 2016 to May 27, 2020. The election was held as part of a general election which also elected members of the Assembly of Experts. This election was the first time that both bodies were elected simultaneously. There were 54,915,024 registered voters (in Iran, the voting age is 18). More than 12,000 people filed to run for office. Nomination of 5,200 of candidates, mostly Reformists, were rejected by the Guardian Council and 612 individuals withdrew.   The 290-seat Islamic Consultative Assembly has 285 directly elected members and five seats reserved for the Zoroastrians, Jews, Assyrian and Chaldean Christians and Armenians (one for Armenians in the north of Iran and one for Armenians in the south). The 285 directly elected seats are elected from 196 constituencies, which are a mix of single and multi-member. In single-member constituencies candidates must receive at least one-third of the votes in the first round. If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round is held with the two highest-vote candidates. In multi-member constituencies, voters cast as many votes as there are seats available; candidates must receive votes from at least one-third of the voters to be elected; if not all the seats are filled in the first round of voting, a second round is held with twice the number of candidates as there are seats to be filled (or all the original candidates if there are fewer than double the number of seats). Voters must be Iranian citizens aged 18 or over, and shall not have been declared insane. According to Iranian law, in order to qualify as a candidate one must: A candidate will be disqualified if he/she is found to be mentally impaired, actively supporting the Shah or supporting political parties and organizations deemed illegal or been charged with anti-government activity, converted to another faith or has otherwise renounced the Islamic faith, have been found guilty of corruption, treason, fraud, bribery, is an addict or trafficker or have been found guilty of violating Sharia law. Also, candidates must be literate; candidates cannot have played a role in the pre-1979 government, be large landowners, drug addicts or have convictions relating to actions against the state or apostasy. Government ministers, members of the Guardian Council and High Judicial Council are banned from running for office, as is the Head of the Administrative Court of Justice, the Head of General Inspection, some civil servants and religious leaders and any member of the armed forces. The conservative camp also known as principlists, consisting of various groups, held the majority of the parliament. The camp spent months bringing together their various wings and formed the “Principlists Grand Coalition”, headed by former speaker of the parliament Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel. The coalition included traditional conservative organizations most notably the Combatant Clergy Association, conservatives close to ex-president Ahmadinejad –who some worked under the name of YEKTA Front– and hardline conservatives largely opposed to the government's policies, like the Stability Front. Campaigning on ""government's failure to deliver on promises of economic benefits from the nuclear deal, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and the lifting of sanctions""; they emphasized their economic backgrounds. On foreign policy, they were against ""allowing American influence to permeate Iranian society and economy"". The incumbent speaker Ali Larijani, declined to join the bloc because ""they have not provided the necessary mechanisms for the creation of unity"" and said he will run independently. The reformists and moderates, centrist allies of President Rouhani, made the “Alliance of Reformists and Government Supporters” or as the reformists named it, the “Pervasive Coalition of Reformists: The Second Step”, a name suggesting a sequel to the first step, 2013 presidential election victory. The coalition was headed by Mohammad Reza Aref and included pro-government moderate conservatives who were on the Followers of Wilayat fraction of Ali Larijani's companions, and aimed to prevent the hardliners from entering the parliament. Larijani himself was also backed by the list. Mohammad Khatami, who renamed the coalition to the “List of Hope” and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani endorsed the list, alongside Hassan Rouhani who tacitly supported them by sending text message to every cell phone encouraging citizens to “to build the future of the country with plenty of hope”. Ali Motahari, who was on the List of Hope, decided to issue another list called “People's Voice” which was mostly made up by moderate conservatives. Ali Khamenei, Supreme leader of Iran, voted on the beginning of election day. He had no comment on the result of the election but asked people for high turnout in election. According to a poll conducted on 18 February 2016 with a ±4% margin of sampling error voters favor supporters of Hassan Rouhani among other politicians: Only 30% of the voters are satisfied with their incumbent representative in the Parliament, with 28% satisfied with the overall performance of the 9th term of Majlis (2012–2016) while 43% are unsatisfied. With the rise of Hassan Rouhani's presidential approval ratings from 54% in August/September 2015 to 67% in December 2015/January 2016, more than 40% undecided voters and some 25% approval of Reformists and Moderates –that are allied under the name of Pervasive Coalition of Reformists– there is a chance of swing towards them. The results indicate that the results would make a hung parliament with reformists having a plurality. The final results are: Four seats are vacant. Which political group is best able to solve the problems of Iran? (iPOS results) Which political group is more aligned with your views? (iPOS results)  Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in Iran on 19 May 2017, However, they might be held earlier under exceptional circumstances, such as the deposition, resignation or death of the President. It will be the twelfth presidential election in Iran.   The President of Iran is the country's highest directly elected official, the chief of the executive branch, and the second most important position after the Supreme Leader. The armed forces, Chief judiciary system, state television, and other key governmental organizations are under the control of the Supreme Leader of Iran. It is also an informal custom that cabinet ministers for sensitive departments like foreign relations and intelligence are coordinated with the Supreme Leader. Of note, the current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. Any Iranian citizen born in Iran, believing in God and the official religion of Iran (Islam), who has always been loyal to the Constitution and is above 21 years of age may register as a presidential candidate. An institution called the Election Monitoring Agency (EMA) and managed by the Guardian Council vets registered candidates (in the 2009 election 36,000 people signed up as candidates) and selects a handful to run in the election. The Guardian Council does not announce publicly the reason for rejections of particular candidates although those reasons are explained to each candidate. Females who register as candidates have invariably been excluded from standing for election by the Council. One of the issues that has been raised in the pre-election debate over electoral reforms, especially regarding enforcement, situations of candidates. Executive of elections under previous law was ministry of interior (Government) and there were statements about changing of maintaining law. In addition, the law provided that the candidates must be political men and the meaning of men was not known. The changes began after the protests to the previous election. According to Iranian law, candidates more than 75 years old are eligible to run but their health issues must be checked by the Guardian Council. According to the official dates announced in August 2016 by the Ministry of Interior: Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS), based in Virginia, asked a random sample of 735 Iranian adults aged 18 and older an open-ended question about their preference for the next president. Among all respondents, 60% were either undecided or expressed that ""it is too soon for them to make a decision"". The poll was conducted on 14–15 February 2015, via telephone interviews on landlines and cellular phones representing every province of Iran. The firm states with 95% confidence that the margin of sampling error is ±3.6 percentage points. Among those who replied a name, the results were as follows: Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS), based in Virginia, asked a random sample of 10,77 Iranian adults aged 18 and older about the next presidential election. The poll was conducted on 11–24 March 2016 (excluding March 20) via telephone interviews on landlines and cellular phones. The firm states with 95% confidence that the margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points. The results also indicates that respondents with university education prefer Rouhani by a wide margin and Ahmadinejad has a slight advantage in rural areas. Data analysis does demonstrate a statistically meaningful relationship between respondents’ party affiliation and their presidential vote, those self-identify as principlist are most likel to vote for Ahmainejad, while reformists and moderates remain loyal to Rouhani. Among those who claim no affiliation, Ahmadinejad would beat Rouhani.  "
8,Shinzo Abe,"Shinzō Abe (安倍 晋三, Abe Shinzō?, IPA: ; born 21 September 1954) is the current Prime Minister of Japan, re-elected to the position in December 2012, and is currently one of the longest serving PMs in Japanese history. He is also the President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe served for a year as Prime Minister, from 2006 to 2007. Hailing from a politically prominent family, at age 52, Abe became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister, and the first to be born after World War II, when he was elected by a special session of the National Diet in September 2006. Abe resigned on 12 September 2007, for health reasons. Abe was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda, beginning a string of five Prime Ministers, none of whom retained office for more than sixteen months, before Abe staged a political comeback. On 26 September 2012, Abe defeated former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba, in a run-off vote, to win the LDP Presidential Election. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Abe became the Prime Minister again. Abe is the first former Prime Minister to return to the office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948. Abe was re-elected at the 2014 general election, retaining his two-thirds majority with coalition partner Komeito. On the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, Abe's cabinet decided to follow previous governments' position on Japan's wartime past, and included the statements of ""apology,"" ""colonization,"" ""aggression,"" and ""remorseful regret"" to the sufferings affected during the war.   Abe was born in Tokyo to a politically prominent family. His family is originally from Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Abe's registered residence (""honseki chi"") is Nagato, Yamaguchi, where his grandfather was born. His grandfather, Kan Abe, and father, Shintaro Abe, were both politicians. Abe's mother, Yoko Kishi, is the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi, prime minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960. Kishi had been a member of the Tōjō Cabinet during the Second World War. Since GHQ's policy changed and became more anti-communist, Kishi was released from Sugamo Prison, and later established the Japan Democratic Party. In his book ""Utsukushii Kuni e"" (""Toward a Beautiful Country""), Abe wrote ""Some people used to point to my grandfather as a 'Class-A war criminal suspect', and I felt strong repulsion. Because of that experience, I may have become emotionally attached to 'conservatism', on the contrary"". In 1955, Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party and Kishi's Democratic Party merged as an anti-leftist coalition and was reestablished as the LDP. Abe attended Seikei Elementary School, Seikei Junior High School and Seikei Senior High School. He studied public administration and graduated with the Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Seikei University in 1977. He later moved to the United States and studied public policy at the University of Southern California's School of Public Policy for three semesters. In April 1979, Abe began working for Kobe Steel. He left the company in 1982 and pursued a number of government positions including executive assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, private secretary to the chairperson of the LDP General Council, and private secretary to the LDP secretary-general. Shinzō Abe was elected to the first district of Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1993 after his father's death in 1991, winning the most votes of the four Representatives elected in the SNTV multi-member district. In 1999, he became Director of the Social Affairs Division, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary in the Yoshirō Mori and Junichirō Koizumi Cabinets from 2000–2003, after which he was appointed Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party. Abe is a member of the Mori Faction (formally, the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai) of the Liberal Democratic Party. This faction is headed by former prime minister Yoshirō Mori. Jun'ichirō Koizumi was a member of the Mori Faction prior to leaving it, as is the custom when accepting a high party post. From 1986 to 1991, Abe's father, Shintaro, headed the same faction. The Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai has 60 members in the House of Representatives and 26 in the House of Councillors. In 2000, Abe's home and the office of his supporters in Shimonoseki, in Yamaguchi Prefecture, were attacked with molotov cocktails on numerous occasions. The perpetrators were several yakuza members belonging to the Kudo-kai, a Kitakyushu-based designated boryokudan syndicate. The reason for the attacks was believed to be that Abe's local aide refused to give cash to a Shimonoseki real estate broker in return for supporting a Shimonoseki mayoral candidate in 1999. Abe was chief negotiator for the Japanese government on behalf of the families of Japanese abductees taken to North Korea. As a part of the effort, he accompanied Koizumi to meet Kim Jong‑il in 2002. He gained national popularity when he demanded that Japanese abductees visiting Japan remain, in defiance of North Korea. He was the leader of a project team within the LDP that did a survey on ""excessive sexual education and gender-free education"". Among the items to which this team raised objections were anatomical dolls and other curricular materials ""not taking into consideration the age of children"", school policies banning traditional boys' and girls' festivals, and mixed-gender physical education. The team sought to provide contrast to the Democratic Party of Japan, which it alleged supported such policies. On September 20, 2006, Abe was elected as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His chief competitors for the position were Sadakazu Tanigaki and Tarō Asō. Yasuo Fukuda was a leading early contender but ultimately chose not to run. Former Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori, to whose faction both Abe and Fukuda belonged, stated that the faction strongly leant toward Abe. On 26 September 2006 Abe was elected prime minister with 339 of 475 votes in the Diet's lower house and a firm majority in the upper house. Abe, elected at age 52, was the youngest prime minister since Fumimaro Konoe in 1941. Abe expressed a general commitment to the fiscal reforms instituted by his predecessor, Jun'ichirō Koizumi. He has taken some steps toward balancing the Japanese budget, such as appointing a tax policy expert, Kōji Omi, as Minister of Finance. Omi has previously supported increases in the national consumption tax, although Abe has distanced himself from this policy and seeks to achieve much of his budget balancing through spending cuts. Since 1997, as the bureau chief of ""Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About The Outlook of Japan and History Education"", Abe supported the controversial Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform and the New History Textbook. In March 2007, Abe along with right-wing politicians have proposed a bill to encourage nationalism and a ""love for one's country and hometown"" among the Japanese youth (specific wording from the revised ""fundamental law of education"" 教育基本法, which was revised to include ""love of country"" despite much criticism). Abe held conservative views in the Japanese succession controversy, and shortly after the birth of Prince Hisahito of Akishino he abandoned a proposed legislative amendment to permit women to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne. Shinzō Abe has generally taken a hard-line stance with respect to North Korea, especially regarding the North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens. In 2002 negotiations between Japan and North Korea, Prime Minister Koizumi and General Secretary Kim Jong-il agreed to give abductees permission to visit Japan. A few weeks into the visit, the Japanese government decided that the abductees would be restricted from returning to North Korea where their families live. Abe took credit for this policy decision in his best-selling book, Towards a Beautiful Nation (美しい国へ, Utsukushii kuni e?). North Korea criticized this Japanese decision as a breach of a diplomatic promise, and the negotiations aborted. Abe has publicly recognized the need for improved relations with the People's Republic of China and, along with Foreign Minister Taro Aso, sought an eventual summit meeting with former Chinese paramount leader Hu Jintao. Abe has also said that China–Japan relations should not continue to be based on emotions. Occasionally, Abe is respected among politicians in Taiwan who are part of the Pan-Green Coalition seeking Taiwanese independence. Chen Shui-bian welcomed Abe's ministership. Part of Abe's appeal in Taiwan is historical: his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was pro-Taiwan, and his great-uncle Eisaku Satō was the last prime minister to visit Taiwan while in office. Abe has expressed the need to strengthen political, security, and economic ties within the Southeast Asian region. Abe has increased its allies in its international campaign to counter the North Korean nuclear cards. So far, Abe has successfully visited the Philippines and Indonesia, and although China is not within the Southeast Asian region, Japan has also sought for their support. However, relations with China continue to be tarnished by the Senkaku Islands dispute and Abe's visits to Yasukuni shrine (see below). Abe, in his two terms as the prime minister of Japan, sought to upgrade the strategic Japan-India relationship. Abe initiated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Japan, the United States, Australia and India in 2007. His three-day visit to India in August 2007 inaugurated a new bilateral Asian alliance, building on the long history of strong, friendly bilateral relations between India and Japan. Abe's initiative is to establish the ""fifth"" bilateral link in an emerging scenario, whereby, the U.S.–Australia, U.S.–Japan, Japan–Australia, and U.S.–India links are supportive strategic alignments. A sixth link of the India-Australia would be the logical corollary, formalized as a new quadrilateral of strategic bulwark. The eventual expansion to include Vietnam, South Korea, Philippines and Indonesia, in this arrangement, has been speculated in the media of those states. Chinese strategic experts have labelled the evolving geo-strategic paradigm, the ""Asian NATO"". Abe's pragmatic India foreign policy, is to boost Japan's resurgent economic indicators, while gaining a crucial partner in Asia. India, unlike most major Far-Eastern and ASEAN states, does not have a history of serious military dispute with Japan. Abe also sought to revise or broaden the interpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution in order to permit Japan to maintain de jure military forces. He had stated that ""we are reaching the limit in narrowing down differences between Japan's security and the interpretation of our constitution"". During his first period as prime minister he upgraded the Japan Defense Agency to full ministry status. Like his predecessors, he supported the Japanese alliance with the United States. Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered great losses in the upper house election, marking the first time it had lost control in 52 years. Another agricultural minister, Norihiko Akagi, who was involved in a political funding scandal, resigned after the election. In an attempt to revive his administration, Abe announced a new cabinet on 27 August 2007. However, the new agricultural minister Takehiko Endo, involved in a finance scandal, resigned only 7 days later. On 12 September 2007, only three days after a new parliamentary session had begun, Abe announced his intention to resign his position as prime minister at an unscheduled press conference. Abe said his unpopularity was hindering the passage of an anti-terrorism law, involving among other things Japan's continued military presence in Afghanistan. Party officials also said the embattled prime minister was suffering from poor health. On 26 September 2007 Abe officially ended his term as Yasuo Fukuda became the new prime minister of Japan. Abe later revealed that the illness that contributed to ending his first term as Prime Minister was ulcerative colitis, but that he has since recovered due to access to a drug, Asacol, that was previously unavailable in Japan. When he returned to office he used his own case to argue for lessening the time it takes to approve potentially innovative drugs. After resigning as Prime Minister, Abe remained in the National Diet and was re-elected in his Yamaguchi 4th district at the 2009 election when the LDP lost power to the Democratic Party of Japan. On 26 September 2012, Abe was re-elected as president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party defeating former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba in a runoff vote by 108 votes to 89. Abe returned to the LDP leadership at a time of political turmoil, the governing DPJ had lost its majority in the lower house due to party splits over nuclear policies and the cabinet's move to raise the consumption tax from 5 to 10 percent. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda was forced to rely on the LDP to pass the Consumption Tax bill and in return was pressured by Abe and the opposition parties to hold a snap general election. Noda agreed to this on the conditions that the LDP passed a bond-financing bill, and would support a commission to reform the social security system and address electoral malapportionment in the next diet session. On 16 November 2012, Prime Minister Noda announced the dissolution of the lower house and that the general election would be held on 16 December. Abe campaigned using the slogan ""Nippon o Torimodosu"" (""Take back Japan""), promising economic revival through monetary easing, higher public spending and the continued use of nuclear energy, and a tough line in territorial disputes. In the elections on 16 December 2012, the LDP won 294 seats in the 480 seat House of Representatives. Together with the New Komeito Party (which has partnered with the LDP since the late 1990s), Abe was able to form a coalition government that controlled a two thirds majority in the lower house, allowing it to override the upper house's veto. On 26 December 2012, Abe was formally elected as Prime Minister by the Diet, with the support of 328 out of 480 members of the House of Representatives, he and his second cabinet, which he called a ""crisis-busting cabinet"", were sworn in later that day. The new government included LDP heavyweights such as former Prime Minister Tarō Asō as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Yoshihide Suga as Chief Cabinet Secretary and Akira Amari as Economy Minister. Following his victory, Abe said, ""With the strength of my entire cabinet, I will implement bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy and a growth strategy that encourages private investment, and with these three policy pillars, achieve results."" In February 2013 Abe gave an address at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC in which he explained his economic and diplomatic objectives, and that he had returned to the Prime Ministership to prevent Japan becoming a ""Tier Two Nation"", declaring that ""Japan is back"". The Second Abe cabinet revived the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP) that had played a key role in formulating economic policy during the Koizumi cabinet, but had been abandoned by the 2009-12 DPJ administrations. Abe declared in his January 2013 policy speech to the Diet that economic revival and escaping deflation was ""the greatest and urgent issue"" facing Japan. His economic strategy, referred to as Abenomics, consists of the so-called ""three arrows"" (an allusion to an old Japanese story) of policy. The first arrow is monetary expansion aimed at achieving a 2% inflation target, the second a flexible fiscal policy to act as an economic stimulus in the short term, then achieve a budget surplus and the third, a growth strategy focusing on structural reform and private sector investment to achieve long-term growth. At the first meeting of the CEFP on 9 January 2013 Abe declared that the Bank of Japan should follow a policy of monetary easing with a view to achieving a target of 2 percent inflation. Abe maintained pressure on the Bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, who was reluctant to set specific targets, into agreeing to the policy. In February, after Abe publicly speculated that the government could legislate to strip the bank of independence, Shirakawa announced he was leaving office prematurely before his term expired. Abe then appointed Haruhiko Kuroda as governor, who had previously advocated inflation targets, and who has pursued the government's policies of monetary easing. After the first meeting of the Bank's monetary policy committee after he had taken office in April, Kuroda announced an aggressive programme of easing intended to double the money supply and achieve the 2 percent inflation target at ""the earliest possible time"". Over the first six months of the second Abe Cabinet, the Yen fell from a high of ¥77 to the dollar to ¥101.8, and the Nikkei 225 rose by 70 percent. In a surprise move in October 2014, Kuroda announced that the BOJ would boost the monetary easing programme and accelerate asset purchases, the monetary policy committee split by 5 votes to 4 but supported the policy. This was interpreted as a response to disappointing economic figures in the aftermath of the increase in the consumption tax to 8 percent, inflation having fallen to 1 percent from its peak of 1.5 percent in April. The Abe Cabinet's first budget included a 10.3 trillion yen stimulus package, composed of public works spending, aid for small businesses and investment incentives, that aimed to increase growth by 2 percent. The budget also increased defense spending and manpower while reducing foreign aid. In Autumn 2013 Abe made the decision to proceed with the first stage of the increase in the consumption tax from 5 to 8 percent in April 2014 (with a second stage envisaged raising it to 10 percent in October 2015). The bill to raise the tax had been passed under the previous DPJ government, but the final decision lay with the Prime Minister. He and Finance Minister Taro Aso explained that the tax would be increased to provide a ""sustainable"" basis for future social spending, and to avoid the need to finance future stimulus by issuing government bonds. While this was expected to affect economic growth in the quarter following the rise, Abe also announced a 5 trillion yen stimulus package that aimed to mitigate any effects on economic revival. After the increase in April, Japan fell into recession during the second and third quarters of 2014, leading to Abe delaying the second stage of the tax rise until April 2017 and calling a snap election (see below). In response to the recession, Aso announced that the government would ask the Diet to pass a supplementary budget to fund a further stimulus package worth 2–3 trillion yen. There has been some division within the Abe cabinet between ""fiscal hawks"", such as Finance Minister Aso, who favour fiscal consolidation through spending cuts and tax increases, and reflationists, such as Abe himself, who argue in favour of a ""growth first"" policy that prioritises economic expansion and recovery over budget considerations using the slogan ""no fiscal health without economic revitalization"". Abe's decision to delay the consumption tax increase in November 2014 and his push for a large fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget without social security cuts was interpreted as a victory for this faction within the LDP. The government did however, commit to a primary surplus by 2020, and pledged to review its strategy in 2018 if the primary deficit had not fallen to 1 percent of GDP by that time. On 15 March 2013 Abe announced that Japan was entering negotiations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this was interpreted by analysts as a means through which the government can enact reforms to liberalise certain sectors of the Japanese economy, most notably agriculture, and was criticised by farm lobbies and some sections of the LDP. Economist Yoshizaki Tatsuhiko described the TPP as having the potential to act as the ""linchpin of Abe’s economic revitalization strategy"" by making Japan more competitive through free trade. In February 2015 the Abe government struck a deal to limit the power of the JA-Zenchu body to supervise and audit Japan's agricultural co-operatives, in a move designed to facilitate TPP negotiations, improve the competitiveness of Japan's farming sector and curtail the influence of the agriculture lobby. Abe revealed the first measures related to the ""third arrow"" policies in June 2013, which included plans to establish deregulated economic zones and allow the sale of drugs online, but did not include substantial measures related to labour market or business reform. These measures were less well received than the first two arrows had been since Abe took office, with the stock market falling slightly and critics arguing that they lacked detail, The Economist, for example judged the announcement a ""misfire"". Analysts did note, however, that Abe was waiting until after the July Upper House elections to reveal further details, to avoid an adverse reaction by voters to potentially unpopular reforms. At the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014 Abe announced that he was ready to act as a ""drill bit"" to break through the rock of vested interests and ""red tape"" to achieve structural reforms of the economy. He cited reforms of agriculture, energy and health sectors as evidence of this, and pledged to push forward with the TPP, a Japan-EU trade deal and tax, corporate governance and planning reforms. Abe announced a package of structural reforms in June 2014, that the Economist described as ""less a single arrow than a 1,000-strong bundle"" and compared favourably to the 2013 announcement. These new measures included corporate governance reform, the easing of restrictions on hiring foreign staff in special economic zones, liberalising the health sector and measures to help foreign and local entrepreneurs. The plans also included a cut in corporation tax to below 30 percent, an expansion of childcare to encourage women to join the workforce, and the loosening of restrictions on overtime. In December 2015, the government announced corporation tax would be reduced to 29.97 percent in 2016, bringing the cut forward one year ahead of schedule. In September 2013 Abe called for a ""society in which all women can shine"", setting a target that 30 percent of leadership positions should be held by women by 2020. Abe cited the ""womenomics"" ideas of Kathy Matsui that greater participation by women in the workforce, which is relatively low in Japan, especially in leadership roles, could improve Japan's GDP and potentially fertility rates, in spite of declining population figures. The Abe cabinet has introduced measures to expand childcare and legislation to force public and private organisations to publish data on the number of women they employ, and what positions they hold. In November 2013 the Abe cabinet passed a bill to liberalise Japan's electricity market by abolishing price controls, breaking up regional monopolies, separating power transmission from generation by creating a national grid company. This move was partly in response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and the bill faced little opposition in the Diet. By March 2015, more than 500 companies had applied to the Economy Ministry to enter the electricity retail market and electricity industry is expected to be fully liberalised by 2016, with gas utilities following suit by 2017. Abe has also said he favours the re-building of Japan's nuclear reactors following the Fukushima disaster(though much of the authority to restart nuclear plants lies with local governments) and plans to strengthen relations with the United States. In 2013 the Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index posted a record 28 percent return, which was credited to the unprecedented actions of the Abe government. In July 2015 the IMF reported that, while the structural reforms had ""modestly"" improved growth prospects, ""further high-impact structural reforms are needed to lift growth"" and prevent over-reliance on yen depreciation. When Abe returned to office, although neither party had controlled the House of Councillors (the upper house of the Diet) since the 2007 election, the opposition DPJ was the largest party. The governing coalition enjoyed a two thirds majority in the lower house that allowed it to override the upper house's veto, but this requires a delay of 90 days. This situation, known as the ""Twisted Diet"", had contributed to political gridlock and the ""revolving door"" of Prime Ministers since 2007. Abe's campaign for the 2013 election focused on themes of economic revival, asking voters to give him a stable mandate in both houses to pursue reforms, and took a more moderate tone on defense and constitutional matters. In the July 2013 upper house election, the LDP emerged as the largest party with 115 seats (a gain of 31) and the Komeito with 20 (a gain of 1), giving Abe's coalition control of both houses of the Diet, but not the two thirds majority in the upper house that would allow for constitutional revision. With no national elections due until 2016, this result was described as giving Abe the opportunity of ""three golden years"" of parliamentary stability in which to implement his policies. Abe's return to the Prime Ministership saw a renewed attempt to downplay Japan's wartime atrocities in school textbooks, an issue that had contributed to his earlier downfall. In 2013 Abe supported the creation of the Super Global Universities program. This is a ten-year program to increase international student attendance in Japanese universities and hire more foreign faculty. There is also funding for selected universities to create English-only undergraduate programs. In 2014 Abe allocated millions of dollars of the fiscal budget to help programs that help single individuals of Japan find potential mates. These programs entitled ""Marriage support programs"" were started in hopes of bringing Japan's declining birthrate which is half of what it was six decades ago up. Shortly after taking office Abe signalled a ""drastic reshaping"" of foreign policy, and promised to pursue diplomacy with a global, rather than a regional or bilateral outlook based on ""the fundamental values of freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law"". His choice of Fumio Kishida as foreign minister was interpreted as a sign that he would pursue a more moderate line compared to his hawkish stance in the run up the general election. Within weeks of returning to power, the Second Abe cabinet faced the In Amenas hostage crisis of 2013 in which 10 Japanese citizens were killed. Abe condemned the killings as ""absolutely unforgivable"" and confirmed that Japan and Britain had co-operated over the incident. Abe believed that this incident demonstrated the need for the creation of a Japanese National Security Council (see below), and convened a panel to consider its creation soon after the crisis. Abe has been unusually active in the field of foreign affairs for a Japanese Prime Minister, making visits to 49 countries between December 2012 and September 2014, a number that has been described as ""unprecedented"" (by contrast, his immediate two predecessors Naoto Kan and Yoshihiko Noda visited a combined total of 18 countries between June 2010 and December 2012). This was interpreted as a means to offset poor relations with China and Korea by increasing Japan's profile on the world stage and improving bilateral ties with other countries in the region. South East Asian nations, Australia and India have been significant and frequent destinations for Abe, who visited all 10 ASEAN countries in his first year in office. The diplomatic tours also functioned as another element of Abenomics by promoting Japan to the international business community and opening up avenues for trade, energy and defence procurement deals (for example, business executives often travel with Abe on these visits). In September 2013, Abe intervened to aid Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic games, giving a speech in English at the IOC session in Buenos Aires, in which he extolled the role of sport in Japan and sought to reassure the committee that any ongoing issues with the Fukushima plant were under control. After the bid was successful, Abe sought to portray the games as symbolic of his Abenomics economic revitalization programme, saying ""I want to make the Olympics a trigger for sweeping away 15 years of deflation and economic decline"". In 2014 he said that he hoped a ""robot olympics"" would be held at the same time, to promote the robotics industry. Abe's foreign policy has moved Japan away from its traditional focus on the ""big three"" bilateral relationships with the United States, China, and South Korea, and has sought to increase Japan's international profile by expanding ties with NATO, the EU, and other organisations beyond the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, Abe and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to establish a ""2 + 2 framework"" of annual consultations between the British and Japanese foreign and defense ministries, with Abe calling for greater co-operation on issues ""from peace of the seas to the security of the skies, space and cyberspace"". This followed a similar agreement with French ministers in Tokyo earlier in the year. Abe concluded the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement with Australia's Abbott Government in 2014, and addressed a joint sitting of the Australian Parliament in July. In heralding the agreement, he also offered condolences for the suffering of Australians during World War Two - singling out the Kokoda Track campaign and Sandakan Death Marches. He was the first Japanese PM to address the Australian parliament. In January 2014, Abe became the first Japanese leader to attend India's Republic Day Parade in Delhi as chief guest, during a three-day visit where he and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to increase co-operation over economic, defence and security issues and signed trade agreements related to energy, tourism and telecoms. A close relationship was anticipated between Abe and Narendra Modi after the latter's election as Prime Minister of India in May 2014, when it was noted that they had established ties from at least seven years previously when Modi was still Chief Minister of Gujarat and that Modi was one of three people Abe ""followed"" on Twitter. The two men exchanged congratulatory messages after the election. Modi made his first major foreign visit to Japan in autumn of 2014, where he and Abe discussed agreements on nuclear co-operation, rare earth elements and joint maritime exercises. During the visit Abe invited Modi to become the first Indian leader to stay at the Imperial State Guest House in Kyoto. On 30 May 2014, Abe told officials from the ASEAN countries, the United States and Australia, that Japan wanted to play a major role in maintaining regional security, a departure from the passiveness it has displayed since World War II. He offered Japan's support to other countries in resolving territorial disputes. Relations between Japan and its immediate neighbours, China and South Korea, remained poor after Abe's return to office. While he declared that the ""doors are always open on my side"", no bilateral meetings between Abe and the Chinese leadership took place for the first 23 months of his second term. Neither did Abe hold any meetings with President Park Geun-hye of Korea during his 2012-14 term of office. Both countries criticised Abe's visit to Yasukuni Shrine in December 2013, with China's Foreign Minister describing the action as moving Japan in an ""extremely dangerous"" direction. In addition, China has continued to criticise Abe's defense reform policies, warning that Japan should not abandon its post-war policy of pacifism. Abe's speech at the World Economic Forum in 2014 was interpreted as a criticism of Chinese foreign and defense policy when he said that ""the dividends of growth in Asia must not be wasted on military expansion"" and called for greater preservation of the freedom of the seas under the rule of law, although he did not specifically refer to any one country during his remarks. In November 2014, Abe met China's President Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in Beijing for the first time since either had taken office, after a photocall that was described as ""awkward"" by the press. Abe later told reporters that during the meeting he suggested establishing a hotline between Tokyo and Beijing to help resolve any maritime clashes, and that the ""first step"" had been taken to improve relations. Abe has attempted to centralize security policy in the Prime Minister's office by creating the Japanese National Security Council to better coordinate national security policy, and by ordering the first National Security Strategy in Japan's history. Based on the American body of the same name, the law to create the NSC was passed in November 2013 and began operating the following month when Abe appointed Shotaro Yachi as Japan's first National Security Advisor. In December 2013, Abe announced a five-year plan of military expansion. He described this as ""proactive pacificism"", with the goal of making Japan a more ""normal"" country, able to defend itself. This was in reaction to a Chinese buildup and a decreased American influence in the region. In the same month the Diet passed the Abe cabinet's State Secrecy Law, which took effect in December 2014. The law expanded the scope for the government to designate what information constitutes a state secret and increased penalties for bureaucurats and journalists who leak such information to up to 10 years in prison and a 10 million yen fine. The passage of the law proved controversial, with thousands protesting the bill in Tokyo and the cabinet's approval rating falling below 50 percent for the first time in some polls. Detractors argued that the law was ambiguous and therefore gave the government too much freedom to decide which information to classify, that it could curtail freedom of the press, and that the cabinet had rushed the legislation without including any corresponding freedom of information guarantees. Abe argued that the law was necessary and applied only in cases of national security, diplomacy, public safety and counter-terrorism, saying, ""If the law prevents films from being made, or weakens freedom of the press, I'll resign"". However he did concede that, in retrospect, the government should have explained the details of the bill more carefully to the public. In July 2014 the Abe cabinet took the decision to re-interpret Japan's constitution to allow for the right of ""Collective Self-Defense"". This would allow the Self Defense Forces to come to the aid of, and defend, an ally under attack, whereas the previous interpretation of the constitution was strictly pacifist and allowed for force to be used only in absolute self-defense. The decision was supported by the United States, which has argued for greater scope for action by Japan as a regional ally, and led to a revision of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines in 2015. In response the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the decision ""raised doubts"" about Japan's commitment to peace, and argued that the Japanese public is opposed to the concept of collective self-defense. Abe argued that the move would not lead to Japan becoming involved in ""foreign wars"" such as the Gulf or Iraq war, but instead would secure peace through deterrence. This led to the introduction of the 2015 security legislation to give legal effect to the cabinet's decision (see below). The cabinet inaugurated in December 2012 was the longest serving and most stable in post-war Japanese history, lasting 617 days without a change in personnel until Abe conducted a reshuffle in September 2014, with the stated aim of promoting more women into ministerial posts. The reshuffled cabinet tied the record of 5 women ministers set by the first Koizumi cabinet. Most key figures, such as Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga, were kept in post although Abe moved Justice Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki out of cabinet to become Secretary General of the LDP. However, on October 20 two of the women promoted in the reshuffe, Justice Minister Midori Matsushima and Trade Minister Yuko Obuchi, were forced to resign in separate election finance scandals. Abe told the press ""As prime minister, I bear full responsibility for having appointed them, and I apologize deeply to the people of Japan."" In November 2014, while Abe was attending the APEC forum meeting in China and the G20 Summit in Australia, rumours began appearing in the press that he was planning to call a snap election in the event that he decided to delay the second stage of the consumption tax increase. It was speculated that Abe planned to do this to ""reset"" Diet business after it had become gridlocked due to the fallout from ministerial resignations in October, or because the political situation would be less favourable to re-election in 2015 and 2016. On 17 November GDP figures were released that showed Japan had fallen into recession, the two quarters of negative growth following the first stage in the consumption tax rise in April. Abe held a press conference on 21 November and announced that he was delaying the rise in the consumption tax by 18 months, from October 2015 to April 2017, and calling a snap general election for 14 December. Abe described the election as the ""Abenomics Dissolution"" and asked the voters to pass judgement on his economic policies. Abe's popularity fell slightly with the announcement and he declared that he would resign if his coalition did not win a simple majority, though analysts agreed this was highly unlikely due to the weak state of the opposition. The opposition parties attempted to field a united front in opposition to Abe's policies, but found themselves divided on them. In the elections, the LDP won 291 seats, a loss of 3, but the Komeito gained 4 to win 35. Therefore, the governing coalition maintained its two thirds majority in a slightly-reduced lower house of 475. On December 24 Abe was re-elected to the position of Prime Minister by the House of Representatives, the only change he made when introducing his third cabinet was replacing defense minister Akinori Eto, who was also involved in a political funding controversy, with Gen Nakatani. In his February policy speech, Abe called upon the new Diet to enact “most drastic reforms since the end of World War II” in the areas of the economy, agriculture, healthcare and other sectors. On a tour of the Middle East in January 2015, Abe announced that Japan would provide 200 million dollars in non-military assistance to countries fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as part of a 2.5 billion dollar aid package. Shortly after this, ISIL released a video in which a masked figure (identified as Mohammed Emwazi or ""Jihadi John"") threatened to kill two Japanese hostages, Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, in retaliation for the move unless Abe's government paid 200 million dollars of ransom money. Abe cut short his trip to deal with the crisis, declared that such acts of terrorism were ""unforgivable"" and promised to save the hostages, while refusing to pay the ransom. The Abe cabinet worked with the Jordanian government to attempt to secure the release of both hostages, after further videos were released by ISIL linking their fate to that of pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh, with deputy foreign minister Yasuhide Nakayama conducting negotiations in Amman. Both hostages were killed, ISIL releasing news of Yukawa's death on January 24 and Goto's on January 31. Abe condemned the killings as a ""heinous act"", declared that Japan would ""not give in to terrorism"" and pledged to work with the international community to bring the killers to justice. There was some criticism of Abe for his move to pledge aid against ISIL while they were holding Japanese citizens hostage, but polls showed support for his administration increasing in the aftermath of the crisis. He later used the example of the hostage crisis to argue the case for the collective self-defense legislation that his government introduced in the summer of 2015 (see below). In April 2015, he addressed a joint sitting of the U.S. Congress, the first Japanese prime minister to do so. In his speech he referred to the Japan-US Alliance as the ""Alliance of Hope"", promised that Japan would play a more active security and defence role in the alliance and argued that the TPP would bring both economic and security benefits to the Asia-Pacific region. The address served as part of a state visit to the United States, the eighth of the Obama Presidency, which the president referred to as a ""celebration of the ties of friendship"" between America and Japan. During the visit, Abe attended a state dinner at the White House. Like his predecessors Tomiichi Murayama and Junichiro Koizumi, Abe issued a statement commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on August 14, 2015. This statement had been widely anticipated, with some commentators expecting Abe to amend or even refuse to repeat the previous leaders' apologies for Japan's role in the war. In the statement, Abe committed to uphold the previous apologies and expressed ""profound grief and eternal, sincere condolences"" for the ""immeasurable damage and suffering"" Japan had caused for ""innocent people"" during the conflict. He also argued that Japan should not be ""predestined to apologise"" forever, noting that more than eighty percent of Japanese people alive today were born after the conflict and played no part in it. The governments of both China and South Korea responded with criticism of the statement, but analysts noted that it was muted and restrained in tone, in comparison to the harsher rhetoric that has been used previously. A representative of the US National Security Council welcomed the statement, and referred to Japan as having been a ""model for nations everywhere"" in its record on ""peace, democracy, and the rule of law"" since the war's end. Professor Gerald Curtis of Colombia University argued that the statement ""probably satisfies no constituency"" either in Japan or abroad, but that by repeating the words ""aggression"", ""colonialism"", ""apology"" and ""remorse"" used in the Murayama Statement of 1995, it was likely to be enough to improve relations with China and Korea. In December 2015, Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed deals in which India agreed to buy Shinkansen technology from Japan, (financed in part by a loan from the Japanese government), and for Japan to be raised to full partner status in the Malabar naval exercises. Also agreed at the talks was a proposal for Japan to sell non-military nuclear technology to India, to be formally signed once technical details were finalised. Demonstrating their close relationship, Abe described Modi's policies as ""like Shinkansen - high speed, safe and reliable while carrying many people along"". In return, Modi complimented Abe as a ""phenomenal leader"", noted how India-Japan relations had a ""wonderful human touch"" and invited him to attend the Ganga aarti ceremony at Dashashwamedh Ghat in his Varanasi constituency. Analysts described the nuclear deal as part of Japan and India's efforts to respond to growing Chinese power in the Asia-Pacific region. In Seoul in November 2015, Abe attended the first China–Japan–South Korea trilateral summit held for three years with Korean President Park Geun-hye and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. The summits had been suspended in 2012 due to tensions over historical and territorial issues. The leaders agreed to restore the summits as annual events, negotiate a trilateral free trade agreement and work to check North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, and announced that trilateral co-operation had been ""completely restored"". Japan's relations with South Korea have improved somewhat during Abe's third term, in the aftermath of Abe's war anniversary statement. Abe and Korea's President Park Geun-hye held their first bilateral meeting in November 2015, where they both agreed to resolve the issue of so-called ""Comfort women"" which Park described as the biggest obstacle to closer ties. In late December 2015, foreign ministers Fumio Kishida and Yun Byung-se announced in Seoul that a deal had been reached to resolve the ""comfort women"" issue, in which Japan agreed to pay 1 billion yen into a fund to support the 46 surviving victims, and issued a statement that contained Abe's ""most sincere apologies and remorse"". Abe later telephoned Park to issue the apology. In return, the South Korean government agreed to consider the matter ""finally and irreversibly resolved"" and work to remove a statue from in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Both sides agreed to refrain from criticising each other over the issue in the future. President Park stated that the agreement would be a ""new starting point"" for relations between the two countries, although both leaders received some domestic criticism: Abe for issuing the apology, Park for accepting the deal. In his April speech to Congress, Abe announced that his government would ""enact all necessary bills by this coming summer"" to expand the Self-Defense Forces' capacity for operations and to give effect to the cabinet's July 2014 decision to re-interpret the constitution in favour of collective self-defense. Therefore, the Abe cabinet introduced 11 bills making up the ""Peace and Security Preservation Legislation"" into the Diet in May 2015, which pushed for a limited expansion of military powers to fight in foreign conflict. The principle aims of the bills were to allow Japan's Self-Defense Forces to come to the aid of allied nations under attack (even if Japan itself was not), to expand their scope to support international peacekeeping operations, and to allow for Japan to take on a greater share of security responsibilities as part of the US-Japan Alliance. In order to allow for enough time to pass the bills in the face of lengthy opposition scrutiny, the Abe cabinet extended the Diet session by 95 days from June into September, making it the longest in the post-war era. The bills passed the House of Representatives on July 16 with the support of the majority LDP-Komeito coalition. Diet members from opposition Democratic, Innovation, Communist and Social Democratic parties walked out of the vote in protest at what they said was the government's move to force the bills through without sufficient debate and ignore ""responsible opposition parties"". Abe countered by arguing that the bills had been debated for ""as many as 113 hours"" before the vote. While common practice in many other parliamentary democracies, a government using its majority to ""railroad"" controversial bills though the Diet in the face of political and public opposition is a subject of criticism in Japan. As a result of these moves, Abe faced a public backlash, and opinion polls showed that his approval ratings fell into negative figures for the first time since he returned to power in 2012, with 50 percent disapproving and 38 percent approving of the cabinet according to one Nikkei survey at the beginning of August. Many protested the legislation outside the Diet buildings, denouncing what were referred to as ""war bills"" by opponents. Organisers of the protests estimated that up to 100,000 protesters marched against the bills' passage of the lower house in July. During Diet committee hearings on the bills, constitutional scholars (some of whom had been invited by the ruling parties) and a former supreme court justice argued that the legislation was unconstitutional. Abe was publicly criticised by atomic bomb survivor Sumiteru Taniguchi in his speech at the Nagasaki memorial ceremony on August 9, when he stated that the defense reforms would take Japan ""back to the wartime period"". Members of the Abe cabinet said that they would make a greater effort to explain the contents of and the reasons for the security legislation to the public, with the LDP releasing an animated cartoon commercial, and Abe appearing live on television and internet chat streams to make the case for the legislation and take questions from members of the public. The security bills were finally approved 148 votes to 90 by the House of Councillors and became law on September 19, following opposition attempts at delaying tactics and physical altercations in which some Diet members attempted to stop the relevant chairman calling the vote to move the bill out of committee and to a general vote. After the vote, Abe issued a statement saying that the new laws ""will fortify our pledge to never again wage war"", and that the legislation, rather than being ""war bills"", was instead ""aimed at deterring war and contributing to peace and security"". He also pledged to continue to explain the legislation to try to gain ""greater understanding"" from the public on the issue. Following the bills' passage, Abe was expected to once again return his focus to economic issues. On October 18, 2015 Abe presided over the triennial fleet review of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Forces. In his speech to personnel on board the destroyer Kurama he announced that “by highly hoisting the flag of ‘proactive pacifism,’ I’m determined to contribute more than ever to world peace and prosperity”. Later that day he went aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, becoming the first Japanese Prime Minister to set foot on an American warship. In December 2015 the Abe government announced the creation of a new intelligence unit to aid counter-terrorism operations, to be based in the Foreign Ministry but led by the Prime Minister's Office. This was reported as being part of efforts to step up security measures in preparation for the 2016 G7 Summit in Shima, Mie and 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. In the same month the cabinet approved Japan's largest ever defense budget, at 5.1 trillion yen, for the fiscal year beginning in April 2016. The package included funding intended for the purchase of three ""Global Hawk"" drones, six F-35 fighter jets and a Boeing KC-46A midair refueling aircraft. In September 2015 Abe was re-elected as president of the LDP in an uncontested election after LDP Diet member Seiko Noda failed to garner enough support to stand as a candidate. Following this Abe carried out a cabinet reshuffle, once again keeping the key ministers of Finance, Economy, Foreign Affairs and the Chief Cabinet Secretary in post. He also created a new ministerial position for the co-ordination of policies related to the economy, population decline, and social security reform, which was filled by Katsunobu Kato. At a press conference after his official re-election as LDP President, Abe announced that the next stage of his administration would focus on what he called ""Abenomics 2.0"", the aim of which was to tackle issues of low fertility and an aging population and create a society “in which each and every one of Japan’s 100 million citizens can take on active roles”. This new policy consisted of targets which Abe referred to as ""three new arrows""; to boost Japan's GDP to 600 trillion yen by 2021, to raise the national fertility rate from an average of 1.4 to 1.8 children per woman and stabilise the population at 100 million, and to create a situation where people would not have to leave employment in order to care for elderly relatives by the mid 2020s. Abe explained that the government would take measures to increase wages, boost consumption, and expand childcare, social security and care services for the elderly to meet these goals. This new iteration of Abenomics was met with some criticism by commentators, who argued that it was not yet clear if the first three arrows had succeeded in lifting Japan out of deflation (inflation was some way below the 2 percent target), that the new arrows were merely presented as targets without the necessary policies to meet them, and that the targets themselves were unrealistic. However, opinion polls during the final months of 2015 showed the Abe cabinet's approval ratings once again climbing into positive figures after the change in emphasis back to economic issues. At the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks in early October 2015, Abe hailed the agreement for creating an “unprecedented economic zone"" and opening up possibilities for an even wider Asia-Pacific free trade deal and Japanese trade with Europe. He also promised to mitigate any negative effects on the Japanese agricultural sector. GDP figures released in November 2015 initially appeared to show that Japan had entered a second recession since the implementation of Abenomics, however these figures were subsequently revised to show that the economy had grown by 1 percent in the third quarter, thus avoiding recession. In December 2015 the two parties making up Abe's governing coalition agreed to introduce a reduced rate of consumption tax for food when the anticipated tax increase from 8 to 10 percent takes place in April 2017. This deal was reached after Abe was seen to come down strongly in favour of the position held by his junior coalition partner the Komeito, that the tax rate should be reduced, which prompted some disagreement from members of his own party, who favoured a policy of greater fiscal consolidation through taxes. Abe dismissed the chairman of the LDP's tax panel Takeshi Noda (who opposed the reduction), and appointed Yoichi Miyazawa, who was more favourable to the policy, as his replacement. Abe declared the tax deal to be ""the best possible result"" of the negotiations. Affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, Shinzo Abe consistently defends its agenda. Ms.Tomomi Inada is nominated as next Secretary-General of LDP, by Shinzō Abe and it means that she will be nominated as the successor of Shinzō Abe by him, according to the press in Japan, due to her political and historical beliefs which are close to his. Abe is widely viewed as a right-wing nationalist. The British journalist Rupert Wingfield-Hayes of BBC described him as ""far more right wing than most of his predecessors."" Since 1997, as the bureau chief of the 'Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of Japan and History Education', Abe led the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform. On his official homepage he questions the extent to which coercion was applied toward the comfort women, dismissing South Korean positions on the issue, as foreign interference in Japanese domestic affairs. In a Diet session on October 6, 2006, Abe revised his statement regarding comfort women, and said that he accepted the report issued in 1993 by the sitting cabinet secretary, Yōhei Kōno, where the Japanese government officially acknowledged the issue. Later in the session, Abe stated his belief that Class A war criminals are not criminals under Japan's domestic law. In a meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee in February 2006, Shinzō Abe said, 'There is a problem as to how to define aggressive wars; we cannot say it is decided academically', and 'It is not the business of the government to decide how to define the last world war. I think we have to wait for the estimation of historians'. However, on a TV program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was a puppet state. Abe published a book called Toward a Beautiful Nation (美しい国へ, Utsukushii kuni e?) in July 2006, which became a bestseller in Japan. The Korean and Chinese governments, as well as noted academics and commentators, have voiced concern about Abe's historical views. In March 2007, in response to a United States Congress resolution by Mike Honda, Abe denied any government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II, in line with a statement made almost ten years before on the same issue, in which Abe voiced his opposition to the inclusion of the subject of military prostitution in several school textbooks and then denied any coercion in the ""narrow"" sense of the word, environmental factors notwithstanding. This statement provoked negative reactions in Asian and western countries; a New York Times editorial on March 6, 2007 commented for instance: A Washington Post editorial, ""Shinzo Abe's Double Talk"" (March 24, 2007), also criticized him: ""he's passionate about Japanese victims of North Korea—and blind to Japan's own war crimes"". A March 2, 2014 New York Times editorial called Abe a ""nationalist"" who is a profound threat to American-Japanese relations, and a November 14, 2014 opinion piece labeled Abe's position on the subject of comfort women a ""war on truth."" The same editorial presented him as a revisionist, a view largely accepted by the international and part of the Japanese press. The Asahi Shimbun also accused Abe and Shōichi Nakagawa of censoring a 2001 NHK program concerning ""The Women's International War Crimes Tribunal"". The ""tribunal"" was a private committee to adjudicate comfort women; about 5,000 people including 64 victims from Japan and abroad attended. The committee members, who claimed to be specialists of international law, claimed that Emperor Hirohito and the Japanese government were responsible for the use of comfort women. The TV program, however, did not mention the full name of the tribunal and keywords such as 'Japanese troops' or 'sexual slavery', and it also cut the sight of the tribunal, the host grouping, statements of the organizer, and the judgement itself. Instead, it presented criticism against the tribunal by a right-wing academic and his statement that 'there was no abduction of sex slaves and they were prostitutes'. On the day following the Asahi Shimbun report, Akira Nagai, the chief producer and primary person responsible for the program, held a press conference and ensured the report of the Asahi Shimbun. Abe stated that the content ""had to be broadcast from a neutral point of view"" and ""what I did is not to give political pressure"". Abe said ""It was a political terrorism by Asahi Shimbun and it was tremendously clear that they had intention to inhume me and Mr. Nakagawa politically, and it is also clear that it was complete fabrication."" He also characterized the tribunal as a ""mock trial"" and raised objection to the presence of North Korean prosecutors singling them out as agents of North Korean government. Abe's actions in the NHK incident have been criticized as being both illegal (violating the Broadcast Law) and unconstitutional (violating the Japanese Constitution). A news program aired on TBS on July 21, 2006 about a secret biological weapons troop of Imperial Japanese Army called 'Unit 731', along with a picture panel of Shinzō Abe, who has no relation to the report. Abe said in a press conference, ""It is a truly big problem if they want to injure my political life"". The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications inquired into fact relevance and stated that there had been an omission in editing the TV program fairly, making an administrative direction of exceptional stringent warning based upon Broadcast Law. On October 24, 2006, a report emerged that Abe's new administration had called on the NHK to ""pay attention"" to the North Korean abductees issue. Critics, some even within Abe's own LDP party, charged that the government was violating freedom of expression by meddling in the affairs of the public broadcaster. In December 2006, it was revealed that former Prime-Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government, in which Abe was Chief Cabinet Secretary, had influenced town hall style meetings, during which paid performers would ask government officials favorable questions. On November 22, 2012, it was reported that Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) early morning TV show ""Asazuba"" accidentally displayed Abe's photo alongside a news report about an NHK announcer's arrest for a sex offense. Abe's face filled viewers' screens along with the name of NHK announcer Takeshige Morimoto, who anchors NHK's ""Ohayo Nippon"" program on Saturday and Sunday. Morimoto was arrested for allegedly groping a woman on the train. Abe posted on his public Facebook page ""This morning on the TBS show 'Asazuba,' when a newscaster reported on a story regarding the apprehension of a molester, a photo of me was shown. Images of this blunder can now be seen clearly across the Internet, Have the slander campaigns already begun!? If this were merely an accident, it would be proper for the TV station to give me a personal apology, but as yet I haven't heard a single word."" The newscaster acknowledged that the incorrect image had been displayed, but merely stated that the photo was ""unrelated"" and did not refer to the politician by name. Neither Abe nor his office have received any form of apology. Abe has visited Yasukuni Shrine on several occasions. While serving as Chief Cabinet Secretary in the government of Junichiro Koizumi, he visited in April 2006, prompting South Korea to describe the trip as ""regrettable"". He visited again on August 15, 2012, the anniversary of the end of World War II, and after winning the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party, he visited on October 17, 2012 in an official capacity as party president. He initially refrained from visiting the shrine as a sitting prime minister. He did not visit at all during his first term from September 2006 to September 2007, unlike his predecessor Koizumi, who had visited yearly while in office. Abe's not visiting the shrine prompted a Japanese nationalist named Yoshihiro Tanjo to cut off his own little finger in protest and mail it to the LDP. While campaigning for the presidency of the LDP in 2012, Abe said that he regretted not visiting the shrine while Prime Minister. He again refrained from visiting the shrine during the first year of his second stint as Prime Minister in consideration for improving relations with China and Korea, whose leaders refused to meet with Abe during this time. He said on December 9, 2013 that ""it is natural that we should express our feelings of respect to the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation... but it is my thinking that we should avoid making  political and diplomatic issues."" In lieu of visiting, Abe sent ritual offerings to the shrine for festivals in April and October 2013, as well as the anniversary of the end of World War II in August 2013. His first visit to the shrine as Prime Minister took place on December 26, 2013, the first anniversary of his second term in office. It was the first visit to the shrine by a sitting prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi visited in August 2006. Abe said that he ""prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace"" The Chinese government published a protest that day, calling government visits to the shrine ""an effort to glorify the Japanese militaristic history of external invasion and colonial rule and to challenge the outcome of World War II."" Qin Gang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: Abe is ""unwelcome by Chinese people.. Chinese leaders won't meet him any more."" The Mainichi Shimbun argued in an editorial that the visit could also ""cast a dark shadow"" on relations with the United States, and the US embassy in Tokyo released a statement that ""the United States is disappointed that Japan's leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan's neighbors."" The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials urge Abe not to visit the shrine and pay homage to war criminals anymore. Public intellectual Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies, who was a child in Germany when the Nazis rose to power, has stated in response to Abe's visits, ""Unlike Japan,  faced their past, came to terms with it and learned from it. Japan should do the same."" Etzioni criticized Prime Minister Abe's visit to the shrine as well as what he refers to as Japan's recent ""nationalist wave"" in an op-ed for The Diplomat. On August 15, 2014, the 69th anniversary of the surrender of Japan in World War II, Abe chose to not visit the shrine, in what was perceived as a diplomatic gesture to South Korea, China and Taiwan. Despite Abe's absence, China and South Korea both voiced their disapproval at Japan's leadership as a large number of politicians, and three cabinet members did attend the shrine to mark the anniversary. On April 28, 2013, a new public event, the Restoration of Sovereignty Day, was held in Tokyo to mark the 61st anniversary of the end of the US occupation of Japan. It had been proposed by Abe in 2012. The event, which was attended by Emperor Akihito, was denounced by many Okinawans who saw it as celebrating a betrayal, and there were demonstrations in both Okinawa and Tokyo. In 2015, Abe's government refused to admit refugees affected by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Abe stated that Japan must solve its own problems before accepting any immigrants. Abe has favored short-term working visas for migrant workers to ""work and raise incomes for a limited period of time, and then return home."" Abe's first cabinet was announced on September 26, 2006. The only minister retained in his position from the previous Koizumi cabinet was Foreign Minister Taro Aso, who had been one of Abe's competitors for the LDP presidency. In addition to the cabinet positions existing under Koizumi, Abe created five new ""advisor"" positions. He reshuffled his cabinet on August 27, 2007. Notes:  Abe's father Shintaro Abe served in the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1991 and was foreign minister from 1982 to 1986; he is the son of Kan Abe who served in the House from 1937 to 1946. Abe's mother Yoko Abe is the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi, a former prime minister who was at one time imprisoned as a ""Class A"" war crimes suspect following the war. His older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of Mitsubishi Shōji Packaging Corporation, while his younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. Abe married Akie Matsuzaki, a socialite and former radio disk jockey, in 1987. She is the daughter of the president of Morinaga, a chocolate manufacturer. She is popularly known as the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views, which often contradict her husband's. Following her husband's first stint as prime minister, she opened an organic izakaya in the Kanda district of Tokyo, but is not active in management due to the urging of her mother-in-law. The couple have no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments earlier in their marriage.  "
9,Theresa May,"Theresa Mary May, MP (née Brasier; born 1 October 1956) is a British politician who has been the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since July 2016. She has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidenhead since 1997. May identifies as a one-nation conservative and has been characterised as a liberal conservative. She is the second female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party. The daughter of a vicar, May grew up in Oxfordshire. From 1977 until 1983, she worked for the Bank of England, and from 1985 until 1997 at the Association for Payment Clearing Services, also serving as a councillor for Durnsford in Merton. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons in 1992 and 1994, she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in the 1997 general election. From 1999 to 2010, May held a number of roles in the Shadow Cabinets of William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron, including Shadow Transport Secretary and Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary. She was also Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2003. After the formation of a coalition government following the 2010 general election, May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities, giving up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election, she went on to become the longest-serving Home Secretary since James Chuter Ede over 60 years previously. During her tenure she pursued reform of the Police Federation, implemented a harder line on drugs policy including the banning of khat, oversaw the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners, the deportation of Abu Qatada, the creation of the National Crime Agency and brought in additional restrictions on immigration. Following the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron on 24 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party and quickly emerged as the front-runner. She won the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 5 July by a significant margin, and two days later won the votes of 199 MPs, going forward to face a vote of Conservative Party members in a contest with Andrea Leadsom. Leadsom's withdrawal from the election on 11 July led to May's appointment as leader the same day. She was appointed Prime Minister two days later. On becoming Prime Minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.   Born on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex, May is the only child of Zaidee Mary (née Barnes; 1928–1982) and Hubert Brasier (1917–1981). Her father was a Church of England clergyman who was chaplain of an Eastbourne hospital. He later became vicar of Enstone with Heythrop and finally of St Mary's at Wheatley, to the east of Oxford. May's mother was a strong supporter of the Conservative Party. May was educated primarily in the state sector but with a short spell at an independent Catholic school. She initially attended Heythrop Primary School, a state school in Heythrop, followed by St. Juliana's Convent School for Girls, a Roman Catholic independent school in Begbroke, which closed in 1984. At the age of 13, May won a place at the former Holton Park Girls' Grammar School, a state school in Wheatley. During her time as a pupil, the Oxfordshire education system was reorganised and the school became the new Wheatley Park Comprehensive School. May then attended the University of Oxford where she read geography at St Hugh's College, graduating with a second class BA degree in 1977. Between 1977 and 1983 May worked at the Bank of England, and from 1985 to 1997 as a financial consultant and senior advisor in International Affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Services. Both May's parents died during this period, her father in a car accident in 1981 and her mother of multiple sclerosis the year after. May served as a councillor for the London Borough of Merton from 1986 to 1994, where she was Chairman of Education (1988–90) and Deputy Group Leader and Housing Spokesman (1992–94). In the 1992 general election May stood unsuccessfully for the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming second to incumbent MP Hilary Armstrong by 12,747 votes (27.6%) to 26,734 (57.8%), with future Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron coming third. May then stood at the 1994 Barking by-election, which was prompted by the death of Labour MP Jo Richardson. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945 and Labour candidate Margaret Hodge was expected to win easily, which she did, with 13,704 votes (72.1%). May came a distant third with 1,976 votes (10.4%). Ahead of the 1997 general election, May was selected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead, a new seat which was created from parts of the seats of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham. She was elected with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%). Having entered Parliament, May became a member of William Hague's front-bench Opposition team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998 – June 1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the 2001 election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio. May was appointed the first female Chairman of the Conservative Party in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: ""you know what people call us: the Nasty Party"". In 2003, she was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Transport after Michael Howard's election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader in November that year. In June 2004 she was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for the Family. Following the 2005 general election she was also made Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. David Cameron appointed her Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009 May was made Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. On 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,769 – 60 per cent of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt to unseat her in 2005 as one of the Liberal Democrats' leading ""decapitation-strategy"" targets. On 12 May 2010, when May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet, she became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State, after (in order of seniority) Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister), Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary) and Jacqui Smith (Home Secretary). As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the National Security Council. She is the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since James Chuter Ede who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951. May's appointment as Home Secretary was somewhat unexpected, as Chris Grayling had served as shadow Home Secretary in opposition. May's debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government's measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales. By way of a government bill which became the Identity Documents Act 2010, she brought about the abolition of the Labour government's National Identity Card and database scheme and reformed the regulations on the retention of DNA samples for suspects and controls on the use of CCTV cameras. On 20 May 2010, May announced the adjournment of the deportation to the United States of alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon. She also suspended the registration scheme for carers of children and vulnerable people, with May saying that the measures were ""draconian. You were assumed to be guilty until you were proven innocent, and told you were able to work with children."" On 4 August 2010 it was reported that May was scrapping the former Labour government's proposed ""go orders"" scheme to protect women from domestic violence by banning abusers from the victim's home. On 2 June 2010, May faced her first major national security incident as Home Secretary with the Cumbria shootings. She delivered her first major speech in the House of Commons as Home Secretary in a statement on this incident, later visiting the victims with the Prime Minister. Also in June 2010, May banned the Indian Muslim preacher Zakir Naik from entering the United Kingdom. According to The Telegraph, a Home Office official who disagreed with this decision was suspended. In late June 2010, May announced plans for a temporary cap on UK visas for non-EU migrants. The move raised concerns about the impact on the British economy. In August 2013 May supported the detention of David Miranda, partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald under the Terrorism Act 2000, saying that critics of the Metropolitan Police action needed to ""think about what they are condoning"". Lib Dem peer and former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald accused May of an ""ugly and unhelpful"" attempt to implicate those who were concerned about the police action of ""condoning terrorism"". The High Court subsequently acknowledged there were ""indirect implications for press freedom"" but ruled the detention legal. May also championed legislation popularly dubbed the Snooper's Charter, requiring internet and mobile service providers to keep records of internet usage, voice calls, messages and email for up to a year in case police requested access to the records whilst investigating a crime. The Liberal Democrats had blocked the first attempt, but after the Conservative Party obtained a majority in the 2015 general election May announced a new Draft Investigatory Powers Bill similar to the Draft Communications Data Bill, although with more limited powers and additional oversight. Speaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) conference on 29 June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers. In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including ""stop and search"" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge. On 26 July 2010, May announced a package of reforms to policing in England and Wales in the House of Commons. The previous Labour Government's central crime agency, Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency), was to be replaced by a new National Crime Agency. In common with the Conservative Party 2010 general election manifesto's flagship proposal for a ""Big Society"" based on voluntary action, May also proposed increasing the role of civilian ""reservists"" for crime control. The reforms were rejected by the Opposition Labour Party. Following the actions of some members of Black Bloc in vandalising allegedly tax-avoiding shops and businesses on the day of 26 March TUC march, the Home Secretary unveiled reforms curbing the right to protest, including giving police extra powers to remove masked individuals and to police social networking sites to prevent illegal protest without police consent or notification. In July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than ten percent under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime fighting. In 2014, May delivered a well-known speech to the Police Federation, in which she criticised many aspects of the culture of the police force. In the speech, she said: On 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent student demonstrations in central London against increases to higher-education tuition fees, May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by The Daily Telegraph as ""under growing political pressure"" due to her handling of the protests. In December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been ""resisted until now by senior police officers."" She rejected their use following the widespread rioting in Summer 2011 and said: ""the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities."" May said: ""I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham.... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order."" In the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: ""when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate."" May added that ""what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted."" On 28 July 2010, May proposed to review the previous Labour Government's anti-social behaviour legislation signalling the abolition of the ""Anti-Social Behaviour Order"" (ASBO). She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to ""fast-track"" criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy ""must be turned on its head"", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour. Former Labour Home Secretaries David Blunkett (who introduced ASBOs) and Alan Johnson expressed their disapproval of the proposals. In July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was ""insufficient evidence"" it caused health problems. Explaining the change in the classification May said: ""The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns"", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US. A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with ""acute psychotic episodes"", ""chronic liver disease"" and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations. Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker accused May of suppressing proposals to treat rather than prosecute minor drug offenders from a report into drug policy commissioned by the Home Office. The Home Office denied that its officials had considered this as part of their strategy. Baker cited difficulties in working with May as the reason for his resignation from the Home Office in the run-up to the 2015 general election. In 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000. In February 2015, The Independent reported, ""The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014 – up from 210,000 in the previous year."" In total, 624,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period. Statistics showed ""significant increases in migration among both non-EU citizens – up 49,000 to 292,000 – and EU citizens, which rose by 43,000 to 251,000."" May rejected the European Union's proposal of compulsory refugee quotas. She said that it was important to help people living in war-zone regions and refugee camps but ""not the ones who are strong and rich enough to come to Europe"". In May 2016, The Daily Telegraph reported that she had tried to save £4m by rejecting an intelligence project to use aircraft surveillance to detect illegal immigrant boats. On 11 June 2012, May, as Home Secretary, announced to Parliament that new restrictions would be introduced, intended to reduce the number of non-European Economic Area family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012. The new rules came into effect from 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouse or their child to live with them in the UK. This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. They also increased the current two-year probationary period for partners to five years. The rules also prevent any adult and elderly dependents from settling in the UK unless they can demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a relative in the UK. An MP, who was concerned about this, addressed May in Parliament as to whether she had examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but he received no direct response. Liberty concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile British citizens from the UK. At the Conservative Party Conference on 4 October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, ""because – and I am not making this up – he had a pet cat"". In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was ""genuine"". The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK. Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled ""myths and misconceptions"" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke subsequently called May's comments ""laughable and childlike."" In June 2012, May was found in contempt of court by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of ""totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour"", being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment. May responded to a Supreme Court decision in November 2013 to overturn her predecessor Jacqui Smith's revocation of Iraqi-born terror suspect Al Jedda's British citizenship by ordering it to be revoked for a second time, making him the first person to be stripped twice of British citizenship. May was accused by Lord Roberts of being willing to allow someone to die ""to score a political point"" over the deportation of mentally ill Nigerian man Isa Muazu. According to Muazu's solicitor, May had arranged for the asylum seeker, who was said to be ""near death"" after a 100-day hunger strike, to be deported by a chartered private jet. To strengthen the Home Office's tough stance an ""end of life"" plan was reportedly offered to Muazu, who was one of a number of hunger strikers at the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre. On 7 July 2013, Abu Qatada, a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to Jordan after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees, and numerous prior Home Secretaries had been unable to resolve. The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, and to refrain from torturing him. May has frequently pointed to Qatada's deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that ""he will not be returning to the UK"", and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she ""couldn't deport Abu Qatada"" but that she ""flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good"". The Qatada deportation also shaped May's views on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights, saying that they had ""moved the goalposts"" and had a ""crazy interpretation of our human rights laws"", as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered. In mid 2014, the Passport Office faced a backlog in developing processing passport applications, with around 30,000 applications hit by delays. David Cameron suggested this had come about due to the Passport Office's receiving an ""above normal"" 300,000-rise in applications. It was revealed, however, that May had been warned the year before, in July 2013, that a surge of 350,000 extra applications could occur owing to the closure of processing overseas under Chancellor Osborne's programme of cuts. Around £674,000 was paid to staff who helped clear the backlog. In June 2014, an inflamed public argument arose between Home Office and Education Ministers about responsibility for alleged extremism in Birmingham schools. Prime Minister David Cameron intervened to resolve the row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May's website a confidential letter to May's colleagues, and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office's head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing on the front page of The Times. May held the office of Minister for Women and Equality in parallel to her office of Home Secretary from 2010 to September 2012, when this role was taken over Maria Miller. May's appointment as Minister for Women and Equality was criticised by some members of the LGBT rights movement, because she had voted against lowering the age of consent (in 1998) and against greater adoption rights for homosexuals (in 2002), though she had voted in favour of civil partnerships. May later stated, during an appearance on the BBC's Question Time, that she had ""changed her mind"" on gay adoption. Writing for PinkNews in June 2010, May clarified her proposals for improving LGBT rights including measures to tackle homophobia in sport, advocating British society's need for ""cultural change"". On 2 July 2010, May stated she would be supporting the previous Labour Government's Anti-Discrimination Laws enshrined in the Equality Act 2010 despite having opposed it before. The Equality Act came into effect in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 October 2010. She did however announce that a clause she dubbed ""Harman's Law"" which would have required public bodies to consider how they can reduce socio-economic inequalities when making decisions about spending and services would be scrapped on the grounds that it was ""unworkable"". On 30 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to replace David Cameron, who resigned after the outcome of the European Union membership referendum, in which 52% of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions about leaving the EU and said she could bring ""strong leadership"" and a ""positive vision"" for the country's future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: ""The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door.... Brexit means Brexit"", she said, adding that Article 50 (the formal notification of Britain's exit from the EU) should not be filed until the end of 2016. On the issue of immigration, she agreed that there was a need to regain more control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. Under questioning she conceded that it would not be possible to completely prevent immigration to the UK. In a Sky Data Snap Poll on 30 June 47% of people said that May was their preferred Conservative candidate to be prime minister. May's supporters included a number of Cabinet ministers, such as Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling, Justine Greening, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Fallon and Patrick McLoughlin. May won the first round of voting on 5 July, receiving support from 165 MPs, while Andrea Leadsom received 66 votes and Michael Gove collected 48. According to The Guardian, May was ""almost certain to be among the final two candidates."" After the results were announced, May said she was ""pleased"" and ""grateful"" for the support of other MPs and confirmed that she wanted to unite the party and the UK, to negotiate the ""best possible deal as we leave the EU"", and to ""make Britain work for everyone"". The two candidates with the fewest votes, Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, immediately announced their support for May. May came in first place in the second ballot on 7 July with an overwhelming majority of 199 MPs against 84 for Leadsom and 46 for Gove, who was eliminated. Afterwards, May stated that she was delighted with her support among MPs, and she progressed to a vote of the Conservative Party membership against Leadsom On 11 July, Leadsom announced her withdrawal from the leadership contest hours after May had made her first campaign speech, citing her lack of support amongst Conservative MPs as being a hindrance to becoming a credible prime minister. As the sole remaining candidate, May was declared Leader of the Conservative Party that evening. Soon after she became Leader of the Conservative Party by default on 11 July 2016, David Cameron announced that he would tender his resignation as prime minister two days later, making May the UK's second female Prime Minister after Margaret Thatcher. After being appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 July 2016, May became only the second female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after Margaret Thatcher, and the first female British Prime Minister of the 21st century. May told the media on 12 July 2016 that she was ""honoured and humbled"" to become Prime Minister. Responding to some calls for an early general election to confirm her mandate, ""sources close to Mrs May"" said there would be no such election according to the BBC. In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term ""Unionist"" in the name of the Conservative Party, reminding all of ""the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."" By 15 July, May had travelled to Edinburgh to meet with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. ""I'm coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries,"" she explained. May also appointed new Cabinet members, in what Reuters called ""one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades"", which was also described as ""a brutal cull"" by The Daily Telegraph. Nine of Cameron's ministers, including several prominent members, were sacked or resigned from their posts. The early appointments were interpreted both as an effort to reunite the Conservative Party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union and as ""a shift to the right,"" according to The Guardian. ITV's Political Editor Robert Peston commented: ""Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron's was, her cabinet is more right-wing than his was."" Although May had supported remaining in the EU, she appointed prominent advocates of Brexit (Britain voting to leave the EU) to key cabinet positions responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, including Foreign Secretary, Brexit Secretary, and International Trade Secretary. Overall, of the 25 members of the May ministry (including May), seven supported Brexit, while the other 18 supported Remain. She appointed former Mayor of London Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd her new Home Secretary and former Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond as her Chancellor of the Exchequer. May abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change, which means that now climate change is included in the scope of a new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The move was criticised by Greenpeace which expressed concern the new government failed to see the threat from climate change; by Friends of the Earth which said climate change is happening now while the new government lowers its priority; and the New Economics Foundation environmental economist, Stephen Devlin, who said: ""Tackling climate change is an era-defining challenge that must direct and determine what industries we develop, what transport infrastructure we construct, how we manage our land and what our diets look like. It requires a central co-ordinated strategy; if we leave it to the afterthoughts of other departments we will fail."" The future direction of May's government over climate change is uncertain. Rachel Kyte called for commitment to investment in greener energy supply. Kyte claims investment in greener energy would stimulate the economy and boost jobs at a time of economic uncertainty. Kyte also maintains greater clarity in government energy policy is badly needed. The May Ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary. Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose China's involvement in sensitive sectors. He said that the government was ""selling our national security to China"" without rational concerns and ""the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies."" May had a high approval rating during her first week as Prime Minister. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released on 14 July indicated that 55 percent of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23 percent believed that the Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn would make a good Prime Minister. On 18 July 2016, when George Kerevan asked her whether she would be prepared to authorise the killing of a hundred thousand innocent persons by a nuclear strike; during the ""Trident debate"" inside the House of Commons; Theresa answered affirmatively: On 20 July, May attended her first Prime Minister's Questions since taking office, then afterwards made her first overseas trip as prime minister, visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon–the process for withdrawing from the European Union–before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a ""sensible and orderly departure"" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to ""take a moment"" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the presidency of the Council of the European Union, which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017. May supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and defended selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which is accused of committing war crimes in Yemen, insisting that Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia was ""helping keep people on the streets of Britain safe"". May has identified herself with the One Nation Conservative position within her party. Describing her as a liberal Conservative, the Financial Times characterised May as a ""non-ideological politician with a ruthless streak who gets on with the job"", in doing so comparing her to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Conversely, in The Independent, Rebecca Glover of the Policy Innovation Research Unit contrasted May to Boris Johnson, claiming that she was ""staunchly more conservative, more anti-immigration, and more isolationist"" than he. During her leadership campaign, May said that “We need an economy that works for everyone"", pledging to crack down on executive pay by making shareholders' votes binding rather than advisory and to put workers onto company boards, policies that The Guardian describes as going further than the Labour Party's 2015 general election manifesto. After she became Prime Minister, May's first speech espoused the left, with a promise to combat the “burning injustice” in British society and to create a union “between all of our citizens” and promising to be an advocate for the “ordinary working-class family” and not for the affluent in the UK. ""The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. ... When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we’ll prioritise not the wealthy but you."" In May 2012, May expressed support for the introduction of same-sex marriage by recording a video for the Out4Marriage campaign. May became one of the first high-profile Conservative MPs to pledge personal support for same-sex marriage. She explained, ""I believe if two people care for each other, if they love each other, if they want to commit to each other... then they should be able to get married and marriage should be for everyone"". May supported the UK remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign, but did not campaign extensively in the referendum and criticised aspects of the EU in a speech. It was speculated by political journalists that May had sought to minimise her involvement in the debate to strengthen her position as a future candidate for the Conservative party leadership. Prior to the Brexit referendum May said privately, May also said Britain was more secure as part of the EU due to the European arrest warrant and Europe wide information sharing among other factors. She said, “There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe”. This contrasts with May's public reticence during the referendum campaign which led to criticism from David Cameron among others and charges of hypocrisy. It also contrasts with her position in autumn 2016. Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron said, it was “disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market.” Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, “It’s good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government’s negotiating position.” May has been married to Philip May, an investment banker currently employed by Capital International, since 6 September 1980; the couple have no children. It is widely believed that former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto introduced the two during their time at Oxford. May has expressed regret that, for health reasons, she has not been able to have children with her husband. The Mays are passionate hikers, and they regularly spend their holidays hiking in the Swiss Alps. May is also a passionate cricket fan, claiming Geoffrey Boycott was one of her sporting heroes. May is a member of the Church of England and regularly worships at church on Sunday. The daughter of an Anglican priest, the Reverend Hubert Brasier, May has said that her Christian faith ""is part of me. It is part of who I am and therefore how I approach things"". May is known for a love of fashion and in particular distinctive shoes, wearing leopard-print shoes at her 'Nasty Party' speech in 2002, as well as her final Cabinet meeting as Home Secretary in 2016. On Desert Island Discs in 2014 she chose a subscription to Vogue as her luxury item. However she has been critical of the media focusing on her fashion instead of her achievements as a politician. May was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus of type 1 in November 2012. She is treated with daily insulin injections. Since coming into prominence as a front-bench politician, May's public image has divided media opinion, especially from some in the traditionalist right-wing press. Commenting on May's debut as Home Secretary, Anne Perkins of The Guardian observed that ""she'll be nobody's stooge"", while Cristina Odone of The Daily Telegraph predicted her to be ""the rising star"" of the Coalition Government. Allegra Stratton, then with The Guardian, praised May as showing managerial acumen. Her parliamentary expenses have been ""modest"" in recent years (about £15,000 from 2005 to 2009). Prior to and since her appointment to Government, May actively supports a variety of campaigns on policy issues in her constituency and at the national level of politics. She has spoken at the Fawcett Society promoting the cross-party issue of gender equality. May was nominated as one of the Society's Inspiring Women of 2006. She is the Patron of Reading University Conservative Association, the largest political student group in Berkshire (the county of her Maidenhead constituency). In February 2013, BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour already described her as Britain's second-most powerful woman after Queen Elizabeth II. Prime Minister

10,Angela Merkel,"Angela Dorothea Merkel (née Kasner; born 17 July 1954) is a German politician who is currently Chancellor of Germany. She is also the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). A former research scientist with a doctorate in physical chemistry, Merkel entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, and briefly served as a deputy spokesperson for the first democratically-elected East German Government headed by Lothar de Maizière in 1990. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and has been reelected ever since. Merkel was appointed as the Minister for Women and Youth in the federal government under Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1991, and became the Minister for the Environment in 1994. After her party lost the federal election in 1998, Merkel was elected Secretary-General of the CDU before becoming the party's first woman leader two years later in the aftermath of a donations scandal that toppled Wolfgang Schäuble. Following the 2005 federal election, Merkel was appointed Germany's first woman Chancellor at the head of a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the support of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). At the 2013 federal election, Merkel won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. In 2007, Merkel was President of the European Council and chaired the G8, the second woman to do so. Merkel played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. One of Merkel's consistent priorities has been to strengthen transatlantic economic relations. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the financial crisis at the European and international level, and she has been referred to as ""the decider."" In domestic policy, health care reform, problems concerning future energy development and more recently her government's approach to the ongoing migrant crisis have been major issues during her Chancellorship. Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor. Merkel has twice been named the world's second most powerful person by Forbes magazine, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman. In December 2015, Merkel was named as Time magazine's Person of the Year, with the magazine's cover declaring her to be the ""Chancellor of the Free World."" On 26 March 2014, Merkel became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union and she is currently the senior G7 leader. In May 2016, Merkel was named the most powerful woman in the world for a record tenth time by Forbes. On 20 November 2016, Merkel announced she would seek re-election to a fourth term.   Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in 1954, in Hamburg, West Germany, the daughter of Horst Kasner (1926–2011; né Kaźmierczak), a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin, and his wife Herlind (née Jentzsch), born in 1928 in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), a teacher of English and Latin. She has two younger siblings, her brother Marcus Kasner, a physicist, and her sister Irene Kasner, an occupational therapist. In her childhood and youth, Merkel was known among her peers by the nickname ""Kasi,"" derived from her last name Kasner. Angela Merkel is of Polish and German descent. Her paternal grandfather Ludwik Marian Kaźmierczak was a German policeman of Polish ethnicity, who had taken part in Poland's struggle for independence. He married Merkel's grandmother Margarethe, a German girl from Berlin, and relocated to her hometown where he worked in the police. In 1930 they Germanized the Polish name Kaźmierczak to Kasner. Merkel's maternal grandparents were the Danzig politician Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Alma née Drange, a daughter of the city clerk of Elbing (now Elbląg, Poland) Emil Drange. Merkel has mentioned her Polish heritage on several occasions, but her Polish roots became better known as a result of a 2013 biography. Religion played a key role in the Kasner family's migration from West Germany to East Germany. Her father was born a Catholic, but the Kasner family eventually converted to Lutheranism, and he studied Lutheran theology in Heidelberg and afterwards in Hamburg. In 1954, Angela's father received a pastorate at the church in Quitzow (a quarter of Perleberg in Brandenburg), which was then in East Germany, and so the family moved to Templin. Merkel thus grew up in the countryside 80 km (50 mi) north of East Berlin. Like most young people in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Merkel was a member of the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official youth movement sponsored by the ruling Socialist Unity Party. Membership was nominally voluntary, but those who did not join found it difficult to gain admission to higher education. She did not participate in the secular coming of age ceremony Jugendweihe, however, which was common in East Germany. Instead, she was confirmed. Later, at the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of the FDJ district board and secretary for ""Agitprop"" (Agitation and Propaganda). Merkel claimed that she was secretary for culture. When Merkel's one-time FDJ district chairman contradicted her, she insisted that: ""According to my memory, I was secretary for culture. But what do I know? I believe I won't know anything when I'm 80."" Merkel's progress in the compulsory Marxism–Leninism course was graded only genügend (sufficient, passing grade) in 1983 and 1986. At school, she learned to speak Russian fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and Mathematics. Merkel was educated in Templin and at the University of Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the GDR of that period, and initially resisted by the University of Leipzig; however, with backing of the local leadership of the SED party, the project was allowed to proceed. Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry, she worked as a researcher and published several papers. In 1989, Merkel got involved in the growing democracy movement after the fall of the Berlin Wall, joining the new party Democratic Awakening. Following the first (and only) multi-party election of the East German state, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-unification caretaker government under Lothar de Maizière. In April 1990, the Democratic Awakening merged with the East German CDU, which in turn merged with its western counterpart after reunification. Merkel stood for election at the 1990 federal election, the first since reunification, and was elected to the Bundestag for the constituency of Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen, which is in the district of Vorpommern-Rügen. She has won re-election for this constituency at the six federal elections since. After her first election, she was almost immediately appointed to the Cabinet, serving as Minister for Women and Youth under Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In 1994, she was promoted to becoming Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety, which gave her greater political visibility and a platform from which to build her political career. As one of Kohl's protégées and his youngest Cabinet Minister, she was frequently referred to by Kohl as ""mein Mädchen"" (""my girl""). After the Kohl Government was defeated at the 1998 election, Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU, a key position as the party was no longer part of the federal government. Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the Bundesrat. Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDU—including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, Wolfgang Schäuble, Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was subsequently elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female leader of a German party on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots. Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and polls indicated that many Germans would like to see her become Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's main challenger in the 2002 election. However, she was subsequently outmaneuvered politically by CSU Leader Edmund Stoiber, to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder. He went on to squander a large lead in opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag; Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel. Merkel supported a substantial reform agenda concerning Germany's economic and social system, and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies cannot easily control labour costs when business is slow. Merkel argued that Germany should phase out nuclear power less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned. Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, describing it as ""unavoidable"" and accusing Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of anti-Americanism. She criticised the government's support for the accession of Turkey to the European Union and favoured a ""privileged partnership"" instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union. On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD in the 2005 national elections. Her party began the campaign with a 21-point lead over the SPD in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused gross and net income twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance. Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a flat tax in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel's proposing to increase VAT to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election. On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.3% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag, and both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet. The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005. Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her. Reports had indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differ from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax. When announcing the coalition agreement, Merkel stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it was this issue on which her government would be judged. On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a stalemate election that resulted in a grand coalition with the SPD. Her party was re-elected in 2009 with an increased number of seats, and could form a governing coalition with the FDP. In the election of September 2013 the CDU/CSU parties emerged as winners, but formed another grand coalition with the SPD due to the FDP's failure to obtain the minimum of 5% of votes required to enter parliament. In October 2010, Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had ""utterly failed"", stating that: ""The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it"" does not work and ""we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us. Anyone who doesn't accept that is in the wrong place here."" She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society. On 25 September 2007, Merkel met the 14th Dalai Lama for ""private and informal talks"" in the Chancellery in Berlin amid protest from China. China afterwards cancelled separate talks with German officials, including talks with Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries. One of Merkel's priorities was strengthening transatlantic economic relations – she signed the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007 at the White House. The Council, co-chaired by an EU and a US official, aims at removing barriers to trade in a further integrated transatlantic free-trade area. This project has been described as ultra-liberal by the French left-wing politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon, fearing a transfer of sovereignty from citizens to multinationals and an alignment of the European Union on the American foreign policy and institutions. Der Spiegel reported that tensions between Chancellor Merkel and President Barack Obama eased during a meeting between the two leaders in June 2009. Commenting on a White House press conference held after the meeting, Der Spiegel stated, ""Of course the rather more reserved chancellor couldn't really keep up with ... charm offensive,"" but to reciprocate for Obama's ""good natured"" diplomacy, ""she gave it a go... by mentioning the experiences of Obama's sister in Heidelberg, making it clear that she had read his autobiography"". In 2006 Merkel expressed concern about overreliance on Russian energy, but she received little support from others in Berlin. Merkel favors the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union; but stated in December 2012 that its implementation depends on reforms in Ukraine. Merkel has visited Israel four times. On 16 March 2008, Merkel arrived in Israel to mark the 60th anniversary of the Jewish state. She was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, an honor guard and many of the country's political and religious leaders, including most of the Israeli Cabinet. Until then, US President George W. Bush had been the only world leader Olmert had honored by greeting at the airport. Merkel spoke before Israel's parliament, the only foreigner who was not a head of state to have done so, but this provoked rumbles of opposition from Israeli MPs on the far right. At the time, Merkel was also both the President of the European Council and the chair of the G8. Merkel has supported Israeli diplomatic initiatives, opposing the Palestinian bid for membership at the UN. However, Merkel requested that continued building of settlements beyond the Green Line should stop, and disagreed with the Israeli government's behavior. Merkel's latest visit to Israel was on 25–27 February 2014. During her visit, Merkel was awarded Israel's highest civilian award by President Shimon Peres, for her ""unwavering commitment to Israel's security and the fight against anti-Semitism and racism."" Merkel expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a ""Joint Declaration"" emphasising the Indo-German strategic partnership in 2006. It turned the focus of future cooperation onto the fields of energy, science and technology, and defence. A similar Declaration, signed during Merkel's visit to India in 2007, noted the substantial progress made in Indo-German relations and set ambitious goals for their development in the future. The relationship with India on the basis of cooperation and partnership was further strengthened with Merkel's visit to India in 2011. At the invitation of the Indian government, the two countries held their first intergovernmental consultations in New Delhi. These consultations set a new standard in the implementation of the strategic partnership, as India became only the third non-European country with which Germany has had this nature of comprehensive consultations. India became the first Asian country to hold a joint cabinet meeting with Germany during Merkel's state visit. The Indian government presented the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding for the year 2009 to Merkel. A statement issued by the Government of India stated that the award ""recognises her personal devotion and enormous efforts for sustainable and equitable development, for good governance and understanding and for the creation of a world better positioned to handle the emerging challenges of the 21st century."" In recognition of the importance of China to the German economy, by 2014 Merkel had led seven trade delegations to China since assuming office in 2005. The same year, in March, China's President Xi Jinping visited Germany. In 2015, with the absence of Stephen Harper, Merkel became the only leader to have attended every G20 meeting since the very first in 2008, having been present at a record eleven summits as of 2016. She is expected to host the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit. In 2016, following the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, Merkel was described by The New York Times as ""the Liberal West's Last Defender"" and by Timothy Garton Ash as ""the leader of the free world."" U.S. President Barack Obama described her in 2016 as his ""closest international partner"" throughout his tenure as President. Following major falls in worldwide stock markets in September 2008, the German government stepped in to assist the mortgage company Hypo Real Estate with a bailout, which was agreed on 6 October, with German banks to contribute €30 billion and the Bundesbank €20 billion to a credit line. On 4 October 2008, a Saturday, following the Irish Government's decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she strongly criticised, Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all. However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation. Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2013, she started to say that Europe nowadays has only 7% of the global population and produces only 25% of the global GDP, but that it spends almost 50% of the global social expenditure. The solution to the economic ills of the continent only can consist in raising its competitiveness. Since then, this comparison has become a central element in major speeches. The international financial press has widely commented on her thesis, with The Economist saying that: adding that: The Financial Times commented: {{blockquote|Although Ms Merkel stopped short of suggesting that a ceiling on social spending might be one yardstick for measuring competitiveness, she hinted as much in the light of soaring social spending in the face of an ageing population.} Midway through her second term, Merkel's approval plummeted in Germany, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party. An August 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalition's 51%. However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014. Merkel's approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, during the European migrant crisis, the lowest since 2011. According to a poll conducted after terror attacks in Germany Merkel's approval rating dropped to 47% (August 2016). Half of Germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office compared to 42% in favor. However, according to a poll taken in October 2016, her approval rating had been found to have risen again, 54% of Germans were found to be satifsfied with work of Merkel as Chancellor. According to another poll taken in November 2016, 59% were to found to be in favour of a renewed Chancellor candidature of Merkel in 2017. According to a poll carried out just days after the 2016 Berlin Attack, in which it was asked which political leader(s) Germans trust to solve their country's problems; 56% named Merkel, 39% Seehofer (CSU), 35% Gabriel (SPD), 32% Schulz (SPD), 25% Özdemir (Greens), 20% Wagenknecht (Left party), 15% Linder (FDP), and just 10% for Petry (AfD). The first Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in at 16:00 CET on 22 November 2005. On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, Franz Müntefering indicated that he would resign as party chairman, which he did in November. Ostensibly responding to this, Edmund Stoiber (CSU), who was originally nominated as Minister for Economics and Technology, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005. The second Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 28 October 2009. In 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. However, with their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failing to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, the CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under Merkel's leadership. The third Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 17 December 2013. At the beginning of August 2015, Der Spiegel reported that Merkel had ""evidently decided to run again in 2017"". In 1977 at the age of 23, Angela Kasner married physics student Ulrich Merkel and took his surname. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Her second and current husband is quantum chemist and professor Joachim Sauer, who has largely remained out of the media spotlight. They first met in 1981, became a couple later and married privately on 30 December 1998. She has no children, but Sauer has two adult sons from a previous marriage. She is a fervent football fan and has been known to listen to games while in the Bundestag and to attend games of the national team in her official capacity. On 6 January 2014, Merkel fractured a bone in her pelvis in a cross-country skiing accident in Switzerland. Merkel has a fear of dogs after being attacked by one in 1995. Vladimir Putin brought in his pet Labrador during a press conference in 2007. Putin claims he did not mean to scare her, though Merkel later observed, ""I understand why he has to do this – to prove he's a man. ... He's afraid of his own weakness."" Angela Merkel is a Lutheran member of the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia (German: Evangelische Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz – EKBO), a United Protestant (i.e. both Reformed and Lutheran) church body under the umbrella of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). The EKBO is a church of the Prussian Union. Before the 2004 merger of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia (both also being a part of the EKD), she belonged to the former. As a female politician from a centre right party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Some have referred to her as ""Iron Lady"", ""Iron Girl"", and even ""The Iron Frau"" (all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was ""The Iron Lady""—Thatcher also had a science degree from Oxford University in chemistry). Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar. Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname ""Mutti"" (a German familiar form of ""mother""), said by Der Spiegel to refer to an idealised mother figure from the 1950s and 1960s. She has also been called the ""Iron Chancellor"", in reference to Otto von Bismarck. Stateside, both Donald Trump and Business Insider writer Josh Barro have described Merkel as being similar to Hillary Clinton. In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to have grown up in the former East Germany (though she was born in the West), and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. She studied physics; her predecessors studied law, business or history or were military officers, among others. Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover to Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had triggered the Muhammad cartoons controversy. This happened at a time of fierce emotional debate in Germany over a book by the former Deutsche Bundesbank executive and finance senator of Berlin Thilo Sarrazin, which was critical of the Muslim immigration. At the same time she condemned a planned burning of Korans by a fundamental pastor in Florida. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany and the Left Party (Die Linke) as well as the German Green Party criticised the action by the centre-right chancellor. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper wrote: ""This will probably be the most explosive moment of her chancellorship so far."" Others have praised Merkel and called it a brave and bold move for the cause of freedom of speech. Merkel's position towards the negative statements by Thilo Sarrazin with regard to the integration problems with Arab and Turkish people in Germany has been critical throughout. According to her personal statements, Sarrazin's approach is ""totally unacceptable"" and counterproductive to the ongoing problems of integration. Members of her cabinet and Merkel herself also support state schools enabling Islamic religious instruction (similar to the provision of denominational Christian religious instruction). The term alternativlos (German for ""without an alternative""), which was frequently used by Angela Merkel to describe her measures addressing the European sovereign-debt crisis, was named the Un-word of the Year 2010 by a jury of linguistic scholars. The wording was criticised as undemocratic, as any discussion on Merkel's politics would thus be deemed unnecessary or undesirable. The expression is credited for the name of the political party Alternative for Germany, which was founded in 2013. Her trademark Merkel-Raute has been described as ""probably one of the most recognisable hand gestures in the world"". Its political symbolism received mixed reviews, ranging from being prominently used by the CDU during the 2013 election campaign, to accusations of a cult of personality that were brought forth by her opponents. In July 2013, Merkel defended the surveillance practices of the NSA, and described the United States as ""our truest ally throughout the decades"". During a visit of U.S. President Barack Obama in Berlin, Merkel said on 19 June 2013 in the context of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures: ""The Internet is uncharted territory for us all"". (German: Das Internet ist Neuland für uns alle.) This statement led to various internet memes and online mockery of Merkel. Merkel has compared the NSA to the Stasi when it became known that her mobile phone was tapped by that agency. In response Susan Rice pledged that the USA will desist from spying on her personally, but said there would not be a no-espionage agreement between the two countries. On 18 July 2014 Merkel said trust between Germany and the United States could only be restored by talks between the two, and she would seek to have talks. She reiterated the U.S. remained Germany's most important ally. In August 2014, Merkel visited Ukraine to show her support for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Human Rights Watch said that ""Merkel's visit is an opportunity for her to denounce violations of international humanitarian law by the Ukrainian military."" Her statement ""Islam is part of Germany"" during a state visit of the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu in January 2015 induced criticism within her party. The parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder said that Islam is not part of Germany and that Muslims should deliberate on the question why so many violent people refer to the Quran. In October 2015, Horst Seehofer, Bavarian State Premier and leader of CSU, the sister party of Merkel's CDU, criticised Merkel's policy of allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Middle East: ""We're now in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision."" Seehofer attacked Merkel policies in sharp language, threatened to sue the government in the high court, and hinted that the CSU might topple Merkel. Many MPs of Merkel's CDU party also voices dissatisfaction with Merkel. Chancellor Merkel insisted that Germany has the economic strength to cope with the influx of migrants and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Germany can take. Merkel features as a main character in two of the three plays that make up the Europeans Trilogy (""Bruges"", ""Antwerp"", ""Tervuren"") by Paris-based UK playwright Nick Awde: ""Bruges"" (Edinburgh Festival, 2014) and ""Tervuren"" (2016). A character named Merkel, accompanied by a sidekick called Schäuble, also appears as the sinister female henchman in Michael Paraskos's novel In Search of Sixpence.  "
11,German Election,"The next German federal elections will elect the members of the Bundestag, the federal parliament of Germany, on a date to be determined. German law requires that the next election should take place on a Sunday between 46–48 months after the assembly's first sitting. Since the current Bundestag first sat on 22 October 2013, the latest date for the next election is 22 October 2017. The earliest date is 27 August 2017, the first Sunday after 22 August 2017. By convention, recent elections have been held in late September, avoiding the school holidays. Elections can be held earlier under certain conditions, such as the government losing a confidence motion.   At the previous federal election, in 2013, the incumbent government—composed of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU, the CDU's Bavarian sister party), and the Free Democratic Party (FDP)—failed to achieve a majority of seats. The FDP failed to get over 5% of the vote, denying the party seats in the Bundestag for the first time in their history. In contrast, the CDU/CSU obtained their best result since 1990, with nearly 42% of the vote and just short of 50% of the seats. The CDU/CSU successfully negotiated with the Social Democrats (SPD) to form a grand coalition for the third time. The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term. Half, 299 members, are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, while a further 299 members are allocated from party lists to achieve a proportional distribution in the legislature, conducted according to a form of proportional representation called the Mixed member proportional representation system (MMP). Voters vote once for a constituency representative, and a second time for a party, and the lists are used to make the party balances match the distribution of second votes. Seats are allocated using the Sainte-Laguë method. If a party receives more seats than its vote share entitles it to (overhang seats), additional ""compensatory"" seats are added to the total of 299 to give other parties a proportional number of seats. Voters have two votes, one for the candidate in the single-member constituency and one for the party list in the multi-member constituency. This is a list of the major parties participating in the election.   "
12,Erdogan,"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Turkish pronunciation:  ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician who has been the President of Turkey since 2014. He previously served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2003 to 2014 and as the Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001 and led it to three general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down as leader upon his election as President in 2014. Originating from an Islamist political background and as a self-described conservative democrat, his administration has overseen social conservative and liberal economic policies. His political agenda and ideals are often referred to as Erdoğanism. Erdoğan was a semi-professional footballer playing for Kasımpaşa before being elected as the Mayor of Istanbul from the Islamist Welfare Party in 1994. He was stripped and banned from office and imprisoned for 4 months for the recitation of a poem in a political speech in 1998 after which he abandoned openly Islamist politics and established the moderate conservative AKP in 2001. The AKP won a landslide victory in the 2002 general election, with the party's co-founder Abdullah Gül becoming Prime Minister until his government annulled Erdoğan's ban from political office. Erdoğan subsequently became Prime Minister in March 2003 after winning a seat in a by-election held in Siirt. As part of his '2023 vision' for the centenary of the Turkish Republic, Erdoğan's government oversaw accession negotiations for Turkey's membership of the European Union, an economic recovery following a financial crash in 2001, two successful constitutional referendums in 2007 and 2010, a Solution process with Kurdish militants, an allegedly Neo-Ottoman foreign policy and investments in infrastructure that included new roads, airports and a high-speed train network. With the help of Fethullah Gülen's Cemaat Movement, Erdoğan was able to curb the political power of the military through the controversial Sledgehammer and Ergenekon court cases. In late 2012, his government began peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to end the ongoing PKK insurgency that began in 1978. The ceasefire broke down in 2015, leading to a renewed escalation in conflict. In 2016, a coup d'état was unsuccessfully attempted against Erdoğan and Turkish state institutions. This was followed by purges and an ongoing state of emergency. Nationwide protests against the perceived authoritarianism of Erdoğan's government began in May 2013, with the internationally criticised police crackdown resulting in 22 deaths and the stalling of EU membership negotiations. Following a split with long-time ally Fethullah Gülen, Erdoğan brought about large-scale judicial reforms that were criticised for threatening judicial independence, but which Erdoğan insisted were necessary to purge sympathisers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen. A US$100 billion government corruption scandal in 2013 led to the arrests of Erdoğan's close allies, with Erdoğan himself incriminated after a recording was released on social media. Erdoğan's government has since come under fire for alleged human rights violations and crackdown on press and social media, having blocked access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube on numerous occasions. Erdoğan's government lifted the bans upon court orders. Opposition journalists and politicians have criticised authoritarian tendencies. Analysts suggest that Turkey is a majoritarian democracy. Erdoğan's proponents suggest that since the attempted coup, press restrictions are changing, Erdoğan's government dropped charges against the secular Dogan Group, including Hurriyet paper after it was alleged that the $4.5 billion tax fraud charge was initially perpetrated by Gulenist officers. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, Erdoğan issued a Presidential pardon against those who 'insulted' him. Erdoğan aims to bring the executive Presidency to a referendum in 2017, with a bill likely to pass parliament due to agreement between Erdoğan's conservative AKP and the nationalist MHP.   Erdoğan was born in the Kasımpaşa neighborhood of Istanbul to which his family had moved from Rize Province. Erdoğan allegedly said in 2003, ""I'm a Georgian, my family is a Georgian family which migrated from Batumi to Rize."" However, in a 2014 televised interview on the NTV news network, he said, ""You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian ... even with much uglier things, they have called me Armenian, but I am Turkish."" Erdoğan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father was a member of the Turkish Coast Guard. His summer holidays were mostly spent in Güneysu, Rize, where his family originates from. Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul when Erdoğan was 13 years old. As a teenager, he sold lemonade and sesame buns (simit) on the streets of the city's rougher districts to earn extra money. Brought up in an observant Muslim family, Erdoğan graduated from Kasımpaşa Piyale primary school in 1965, and İmam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973. He received his high school diploma from Eyüp High School. He subsequently studied Business Administration at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences, now known as Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences—although several Turkish sources dispute that he graduated. In his youth, Erdoğan played semi-professional football at a local club. Fenerbahçe wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it. The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasımpaşa S.K. is named after him. Erdoğan married Emine Gülbaran (born 1955, Siirt) on 4 July 1978. They have two sons; Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal, and two daughters, Esra and Sümeyye. His father, Ahmet Erdoğan, died in 1988 and his 88-year-old mother, Tenzile Erdoğan, died in 2011. He is a member of the Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah. While studying business administration and playing semi-professional football, Erdoğan engaged in politics by joining the National Turkish Student Union, an anti-communist action group. In 1974, he wrote, directed and played the lead role in the play Maskomya, which presented Freemasonry, Communism and Judaism as evil. In 1976, he became the head of the Beyoğlu youth branch of the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP), and was later promoted to chair of the Istanbul youth branch of the party. After the 1980 military coup, Erdoğan followed most of Necmettin Erbakan's followers into the Islamist Welfare Party. He became the party's Beyoğlu district chair in 1984, and in 1985 he became the chair of the Istanbul city branch. He was elected to parliament in 1991, but barred from taking his seat. In the local elections of 27 March 1994, Erdoğan was elected Mayor of Istanbul, with a plurality (25.19%) of the popular vote. Many feared that he would impose Islamic law; however, he was pragmatic in office, tackling chronic problems in Istanbul including water shortage, pollution and traffic chaos. The water shortage problem was solved with the laying of hundreds of kilometers of new pipelines. The garbage problem was solved with the establishment of state-of-the-art recycling facilities. While Erdoğan was in office, air pollution was reduced through a plan developed to switch to natural gas. He changed the public buses to environmentally friendly ones. The city's traffic and transportation jams were reduced with more than fifty bridges, viaducts, and highways built. He took precautions to prevent corruption, using measures to ensure that municipal funds were used prudently. He paid back a major portion of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's two billion dollar debt and invested four billion dollars in the city. Erdoğan initiated the first roundtable of mayors during the Istanbul conference, which led to a global, organized movement of mayors. A seven-member international jury from the United Nations unanimously awarded Erdoğan the UN-HABITAT award. In 1998, the fundamentalist Welfare Party was declared unconstitutional on the grounds of threatening the secularism of Turkey and was shut down by the Turkish constitutional court. Erdoğan became a prominent speaker at demonstrations held by his party colleagues. In December 1997, Erdoğan recited a poem in Siirt from a work written by Ziya Gökalp, a pan-Turkish activist of the early 20th century. His recitation included verses translated as ""The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers...."" which are not in the original version of the poem. Erdoğan said the poem had been approved by the education ministry to be published in textbooks. Under article 312/2 of the Turkish penal code his recitation was regarded as an incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred. He was given a ten-month prison sentence of which he served four months, from 24 March 1999 to 27 July 1999. Due to his conviction, Erdoğan was forced to give up his mayoral position. The conviction also stipulated a political ban, which prevented him from participating in parliamentary elections. In 2001, Erdoğan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP won a landslide victory in the 2002 election, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdoğan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gül became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gül handed over the post. In 2009, Prime Minister Erdoğan's government announced a plan to help end the quarter-century-long Turkey–Kurdistan Workers' Party conflict that had cost more than 40,000 lives. The government's plan, supported by the European Union, allowed the Kurdish language to be used in all broadcast media and political campaigns, and restored Kurdish names to cities and towns that had been given Turkish ones. Erdoğan said, ""We took a courageous step to resolve chronic issues that constitute an obstacle along Turkey's development, progression and empowerment"". Erdoğan passed a partial amnesty to reduce penalties faced by many members of the Kurdish guerrilla movement PKK who had surrendered to the government. On 23 November 2011, during a televised meeting of his party in Ankara, he apologised on behalf of the state for the Dersim massacre, where many Alevis and Zazas were killed. Prime Minister Erdoğan expressed multiple times that Turkey would acknowledge the mass killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians during World War I as genocide only after a thorough investigation by a joint Turkish-Armenian commission consisting of historians, archaeologists, political scientists and other experts. In 2005, Erdoğan and the main opposition party leader Deniz Baykal wrote a letter to Armenian President Robert Kocharian, proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian rejected the offer because he asserted that the proposal itself was ""insincere and not serious."" He added: ""This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problem."" In December 2008, Erdoğan criticised the I Apologize campaign by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian Genocide, saying, ""I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise ... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken."" In November 2009, he said, ""it's not possible for a Muslim to commit genocide."" In 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the Statue of Humanity, a Turkish-Armenian friendship monument in Kars, which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a ""monument to humanity"" but ""humanity itself"". The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center. On 23 April 2014, Erdoğan's office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations' shared pain and said: ""Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among one another"". During Erdoğan's time as Prime Minister, the far-reaching powers of the 1991 Anti-Terror Law were reduced and the Democratic initiative process was initiated, with the goal to improve democratic standards in general and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in particular. However, after Turkey's bid to join the European Union stalled, European officials noted a return to more authoritarian ways, notably on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and Kurdish minority rights. Demands by activists for the recognition of LGBT rights were publicly rejected by government members, and members of the Turkish LGBT community were insulted by cabinet members. Reporters Without Borders observed a continuous decrease in Freedom of the Press during Erdoğan's later terms, with a rank of around 100 on the Press Freedom Index during his first term and a rank of 154 out of a total of 179 countries in 2013. Freedom House saw a slight recovery in later years and awarded Turkey a Press Freedom Score of 55/100 in 2012 after a low point of 48/100 in 2006. In 2011, Erdoğan's government made legal reforms to return properties of Christian and Jewish minorities which were seized by the Turkish government in the 1930s. The total value of the properties returned reached $2 billion (USD). Under Erdoğan, the Turkish government tightened the laws on the sale and consumption of alcohol, banning all advertising and increasing the tax on alcoholic beverages. A law raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 24 was in place from 2011 until it was abolished in 2013. Erdoğan argues that the crackdown against Gulenists is a necessary measure, his supporters insist he is maintaining the rule of law, 6000 teachers were re-instated after it was shown they didn't have Gulenist links. In 2002, Erdoğan inherited a Turkish economy that was beginning to recover from a recession as a result of reforms implemented by Kemal Derviş. Erdoğan supported Finance Minister Ali Babacan in enforcing macro-economic policies. Erdoğan tried to attract more foreign investors to Turkey and lifted many government regulations. The cash-flow into the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita; considerably higher numbers were commonly advertised but these did not account for the inflation of the US dollar between 2002 and 2012. The average annual growth in GDP per capita was 3.6%. The growth in real GDP between 2002 and 2012 was higher than the values from developed countries, but was close to average when developing countries are also taken into account. The ranking of the Turkish economy in terms of GDP moved slightly from 17 to 16 during this decade. A major consequence of the policies between 2002 and 2012 was the widening of the current account deficit from 600 million USD to 58 billion USD (2013 est.) Since 1961, Turkey has signed 19 IMF loan accords. Erdoğan's government satisfied the budgetary and market requirements of the two during his administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so. Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership, inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004. Since then, Turkish inflation has continued to fluctuate around 9% and is still one of the highest inflation rates in the world. The Turkish public debt as a percentage of annual GDP declined from 74% in 2002 to 39% in 2009. In 2012, Turkey had a lower ratio of public debt to GDP than 21 of 27 members of the European Union and a lower budget deficit to GDP ratio than 23 of them. The unemployment rate increased from 10.3% in 2002 to 11.0% in 2010. In 2003, Erdoğan's government pushed through the Labor Act, a comprehensive reform of Turkey's labor laws. The law greatly expanded the rights of employees, establishing a 45-hour workweek and limiting overtime work to 270 hours a year, provided legal protection against discrimination due to sex, religion, or political affiliation, prohibited discrimination between permanent and temporary workers, entitled employees terminated without ""valid cause"" to compensation, and mandated written contracts for employment arrangements lasting a year or more. Erdoğan increased the budget of the Ministry of Education from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry. Before his prime ministership the military received the highest share of the national budget. Compulsory education was increased from eight years to twelve. In 2003, the Turkish government, together with UNICEF, started a campaign called ""Come on girls, let's go to school!"" (Turkish: Haydi Kızlar Okula!). The goal of this campaign was to close the gender-gap in primary school enrollment through the provision of a quality basic education for all girls, especially in southeast Turkey. In 2005, the parliament granted amnesty to students expelled from universities before 2003. The amnesty applied to students dismissed on academic or disciplinary grounds. In 2004, textbooks became free of charge and since 2008 every province in Turkey has its own university. During Erdoğan's Premiership, the number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012. The Prime Minister kept his campaign promises by starting the f@tih project in which all state schools, from preschool to high school level, received a total of 620,000 smart boards, while tablet computers were distributed to 17 million students and approximately one million teachers and administrators. Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50. Between the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 and 2002, there had been 6000 km of dual carriageway roads created. Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built. Due to these measures, the number of motor accidents fell by 50 percent. For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed. The construction of Marmaray, an undersea rail tunnel under the Bosphorus strait, started in 2004. When completed, it will be the world's deepest undersea immersed tube tunnel. Construction of the 1.9 km long Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge began in 2013. The chosen name for the bridge led to protests by Alevis in Turkey because of the role Sultan Selim I, nicknamed ""the Grim"" due to his cruelty, played in the Ottoman persecution of Alevis. In March 2006, the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) held a press conference to publicly protest the obstruction of the appointment of judges to the high courts for over 10 months. The HSYK said Erdoğan wanted to fill the vacant posts with his own appointees. Erdoğan was accused of creating a rift with Turkey's highest court of appeal, the Yargıtay, and high administrative court, the Danıştay. Erdoğan stated that the constitution gave the power to assign these posts to his elected party. In May 2007, the head of Turkey's High Court asked prosecutors to consider whether Erdoğan should be charged over critical comments regarding the election of Abdullah Gül as President. Erdoğan said the ruling was ""a disgrace to the justice system"", and criticized the Constitutional Court which had invalidated a presidential vote because a boycott by other parties meant there was no quorum. Prosecutors investigated his earlier comments, including saying it had fired a ""bullet at democracy"". Tülay Tuğcu, head of the Constitutional Court, condemned Erdoğan for ""threats, insults and hostility"" towards the justice system. The Turkish parliament agreed to reduce the age of candidacy to the parliament from 30 to 25 and abolished the death penalty in all instances, including war time. Erdoğan supported the continuation of Turkey's high population growth rate and, in 2008, commented that to ensure the Turkish population remained young every family would need to have at least three children. He repeated this statement on numerous occasions. In 2010, Turkey's population was estimated at 73,700,000, with a growth rate of 1.21% per annum (2009 figure). On 26 May 2012, answering the question of a reporter after a UN conference on population and development in Turkey, Erdoğan said that abortion is murder, saying, ""You either kill a baby in the mother's womb or you kill it after birth. In many cases , there's no difference."" Erdoğan has stated that he opposes Turkey's high and growing rate of caesarean section births because he believes that they reduce the fertility of Turkish women, and he is in favor of limiting the number of such births in Turkish hospitals. In a 2010 meeting with women NGO representatives, asked why he kept addressing them exclusively as mothers, Erdoğan said: ""I do not believe in the equality of men and women. I believe in equal opportunities. Men and women are different and complementary."" In 2014, he addressed the Istanbul Women and Justice Summit of the Women and Democracy Association (Turkish: Kadın ve Demokrasi Derneği, or KADEM): ""Our religion  has defined a position for women : motherhood. You cannot explain this to feminists because they don’t accept the concept of motherhood."" Calling for ""equivalency"" between the genders, he stated: ""You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different,"" while reaffirming that full equality regardless of gender before the law should be maintained. After assuming power in 2003, Erdoğan's government embarked on a sweeping reform program of the Turkish healthcare system, called the Health Transformation Program (HTP), to greatly increase the quality of healthcare and protect all citizens from financial risks. Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides health benefits to the poor, was expanded in 2004. The reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state-run healthcare, which, along with long ques in state-run hospitals, resulted in the rise of private medical care in Turkey, forcing state-run hospitals to compete by increasing quality. In April 2006, Erdoğan unveiled a social security reform package demanded by the International Monetary Fund under a loan deal. The move, which Erdoğan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men. In January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places. Erdoğan is outspokenly anti-smoking. 2013 Gezi Park protests against the perceived authoritarianism of Erdoğan and his policies, starting from a small sit-in in Istanbul in defense of a city park. After the police's intense reaction with tear gas, the protests grew each day. Faced by the largest mass protest in a decade, Erdoğan made this controversial remark in a televised speech: ""The police were there yesterday, they are there today, and they will be there tomorrow."" After weeks of clashes in the streets of Istanbul, his government at first apologized to the protestors and called for a plebiscite, but then ordered a crackdown on the protesters. In December 2013, Turkish police detained more than 50 people and arrested 16 others, including the general manager of Halkbank and the sons of three government ministers, on charges of corruption. Although Erdoğan blamed foreign ambassadors and pro-Erdoğan newspapers accused the United States or Israel of a plot, outside analysts attribute the arrests to a power struggle between the Prime Minister and Fethullah Gülen. Gülen, who lives in the U.S., leads a religious movement that had supported the AKP's rise to power. In late 2013, Erdoğan's government proposed shutting down Turkish private schools, many of which are funded by Gülen. Gülen's supporters are believed to have wide influence in the police and judiciary in Turkey. In late December, Hürriyet and Yeni Şafak papers published comments by Erdoğan stating that he believes he is the ultimate target of a corruption and bribery probe of his allies. The Turkish Prime Minister told journalists that anyone attempting to enmesh him in the scandal would be ""left empty handed."" Erdoğan reshuffled his Cabinet on 25 December, replacing 10 ministers hours after three ministers, whose sons were detained in relation to the probe, resigned. A file containing five audio recordings of conversations between Erdoğan and his son from a 26-hour period beginning 17 December 2013, in which he appeared to be instructing his son to conceal very large amounts of money, was posted to YouTube and widely discussed on social media. On 26 February 2014, Erdoğan acknowledged that his telephone had been tapped, but denied that the conversation was real, instead calling it an ""immoral montage"" that had been ""dubbed"" by combining other conversations. An analysis by Joshua Marpet of the United States, published by McClatchy, concluded that the recordings were ""probably real"", and if not, the fabrication was done with a sophistication he had not previously seen. On the night of 26 February 2014, Turkey's Parliament, dominated by Erdoğan's Justice and Development Party, passed a bill that allowed the government the power to block Internet sites, subject to court review within three days, and granting it access to Internet traffic data. Another bill previously approved by a parliamentary committee would grant the MİT intelligence service access to data held by the government, as well as private institutions and courts. The following day President Abdullah Gül approved placing an investigative agency that appoints judges and prosecutors under the control of Erdoğan's justice minister. On 20 March, Erdoğan made a speech promising to ""rip out the roots"" of the Twitter service. Hours later the telecommunications regulator BTK blocked DNS service to the site, citing four court orders the Turkish government had made requiring them to remove content to preserve privacy that had not been heeded. Sources covering the story attributed this to the use of Twitter to share links to the Erdoğan recordings on YouTube. Erdoğan also threatened to ban Facebook. However, the block of Twitter proved ineffective, with traffic increasing a record 138%, and #TwitterisblockedinTurkey becoming the top trending term worldwide. To circumvent the block, Google suggested Turks use Google Public DNS at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, numbers which were soon graffitied in dozens of locations around Istanbul. President Abdullah Gül criticized the Twitter ban, defying it himself. Two months later, on 3 June, Turkey's telecommunications watchdog ordered the ban to be lifted, after a ruling by the Constitutional Court. On 1 July 2014, Erdoğan was named the AKP's presidential candidate in the Turkish presidential election. His candidacy was announced by the Deputy President of the AKP, Mehmet Ali Şahin. Erdoğan made a speech after the announcement and used the 'Erdoğan logo' for the first time. The logo was criticised because it was very similar to the logo that U.S. President Barack Obama used in the 2008 presidential election. Erdoğan was elected as the President of Turkey in the first round of the election with 51.79% of the vote, obviating the need for a run-off by winning over 50%. The joint candidate of the CHP, MHP and 13 other opposition parties, former Organisation of Islamic Co-operation general secretary Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu won 38.44% of the vote. The pro-Kurdish HDP candidate Selahattin Demirtaş won 9.76%. On 21 August, a 3-hour AKP Central Executive Committee meeting chaired by Erdoğan selected Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as candidate for the party leadership. Erdoğan's last public appearance before assuming the presidency was his parting speech during the AKP's first ever extraordinary congress on 27 August 2014, where his successor as party leader was to be elected. In a 110-minute speech, he criticised rival political parties for their opposition to his bid for the presidency and the solution process with the PKK, vowing to continue the fight against Fethullah Gülen's 'parallel structure'. Erdoğan further stated that his departure would not result in a loss of political vision or electoral support for the party. Erdoğan was one of 1,420 delegates who cast votes to elect the new leader. Ahmet Davutoğlu was the only candidate, having been handpicked by Erdoğan as his successor in a party executive committee meeting on 21 August. Davutoğlu was unanimously elected with 100% of the vote and the support of 1,382 delegates. There were 6 invalid or blank votes. The congress was criticised for lacking any reference to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as well as the lack of competition in the leadership election. Erdoğan took the oath of office on 28 August 2014 and became the 12th president of Turkey. He administered the new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu's oath on 29 August. When asked about his lower-than-expected 51.79% share of the vote, he allegedly responded, ""there were even those who did not like the Prophet. I, however, won 52%."" Assuming the role of President, Erdoğan was criticized for openly stating that he would not maintain presidential neutrality. Erdoğan has also stated his intention to pursue a more active role as President, such as utilising the President's rarely used cabinet-calling powers. The political opposition has argued that Erdoğan will continue to pursue his own political agenda, controlling the government, while his new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu would be docile and submissive. One reason for this allegation was the fact that Erdoğan himself chose Davutoğlu to succeed him as Prime Minister, meaning that Davutoğlu was unanimously elected leader unopposed. Furthermore, the domination of loyal Erdoğan supporters in Davutoğlu's cabinet has also fuelled speculation that Erdoğan intends to exercise substantial control over the running of the government. Erdoğan has also received criticism for the construction of a new palace called Ak Saray (pure white palace), which occupies approximately 50 acres of Atatürk Forest Farm (AOÇ) in Ankara. Since the AOÇ is protected land, several court orders were issued to halt the construction of the new palace, though building work went on nonetheless. The opposition described the move as a clear disregard for the rule of law. The project was subject to heavy criticism and allegations were made; of corruption during the construction process, wildlife destruction and the complete obliteration of the zoo in the AOÇ in order to make way for the new compound. The fact that the palace is technically illegal has led to it being branded as the 'Kaç-Ak Saray', the word kaçak in Turkish meaning 'illegal'. Ak Saray was originally designed as a new office for the Prime Minister. However, upon assuming the presidency, Erdoğan announced that the palace would become the new Presidential Palace, while the Çankaya Köşkü will be used by the Prime Minister instead. The move was seen as a historic change since the Çankaya Köşkü had been used as the iconic office of the presidency ever since its inception. The Ak Saray has almost 1,000 rooms and cost $350 million (€270 million), leading to huge criticism at a time when mining accidents and workers' rights had been dominating the agenda. On 29 October 2014, Erdoğan was due to hold a Republic Day reception in the new palace to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the Republic of Turkey and to officially inaugurate the Presidential Palace. However, after most invited participants announced that they would boycott the event and a mining accident occurred in the district of Ermenek in Karaman, the reception was cancelled. Amid claims that the Turkish government funds IS fighters, several Kurdish demonstrations broke out near the Turkish-Syrian border in protest against the government's inactivity. These protests escalated during the fighting in the border town of Kobane, with 42 protestors being killed following a brutal police crackdown. Voicing concerns that aid to Kurdish fighters would assist PKK rebels in resuming terrorist attacks against Turkey, Erdoğan held bilateral talks with Barack Obama regarding IS during the 5–6 September 2014 NATO summit in Newport, Wales. In early October, United States Vice President Joe Biden accused Turkey of funding IS, to which Erdoğan angrily responded, ""Biden has to apologize for his statements"" adding that if no apology is made, Biden would become ""history to me."" Biden subsequently apologised. In response to the U.S. request to use İncirlik Air Base to conduct air strikes against IS, Erdoğan demanded that Bashar al-Assad be removed from power first. Turkey lost its bid for a Security Council seat in the United Nations during the 2014 election; the unexpected result is believed to have been a reaction to Erdoğan's hostile treatment of ethnic Kurds fighting ISIS on the Syrian border and a rebuke of his willingness to support IS-aligned insurgents opposed to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. As President, Erdoğan has been a strong advocate of an executive presidency that would boost his own powers and has maintained an active influence over political affairs despite the symbolic nature of his office. In 2016, he was accused of forcing the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu due to his scepticism over the proposed presidential system, resulting in his replacement by close ally Binali Yıldırım. He has also come under fire for constructing Ak Saray, the world's largest palace on Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo for his own use as President and has been repeatedly accused of breaching the constitutional terms of his office by not maintaining political neutrality. In 2015, amid consistent allegations that he maintained financial links with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants, revelations that the state was supplying arms to militant groups in Syria in the 2014 National Intelligence Organisation lorry scandal led to accusations of high treason. In July 2015, Turkey became involved in the war against ISIS. The Turkish military has simultaneously launched airstrikes against Kurdistan Workers' Party bases in Iraq. In July 2015, a raid by US special forces on a compound housing the Islamic State's ""chief financial officer"", Abu Sayyaf, produced evidence that Turkish officials directly dealt with ranking IS members. On 18 August 2016, Erdoğan said that ""terrorist organizations such as Daesh, Boko Haram and al-Qaeda were formed to harm Islam and ignite Islamophobia across the world."" Furthermore, he said that ""Daesh is a terrorist organization that casts a shadow, a dark pall over Islam. We could never take sides with Daesh."" The President of Turkey is required to be neutral and independent from partisan politics and all presidents must pledge to adhere to these requirements whilst taking the oath of office. Breaking the presidential oath of office is a violation of the Constitution of Turkey. However, shortly after he assumed the presidency, the opposition accused Erdoğan of breaking the terms of office by being openly partisan in his dealings with the AKP government. In February 2015, Erdoğan was widely condemned by the opposition for calling for people to vote for the AKP in the upcoming June 2015 general election. On 6 February 2015, while giving a speech at Bursa, Erdoğan publicly called for 400 MPs at the next general election in order to push through constitutional changes, continue the Solution process with Kurdish rebels and establish a presidential system. Although he did not mention a specific party, only the AKP formally endorses these three policies. In addition, Erdoğan made an indirect reference to the opposition and criticised them for allegedly being on the side of Fethullah Gülen, which he said would not carry them into government. He also criticised the opposition's legal effort to prevent him from speaking publicly until the June 2015 general election. As President, Erdoğan has overseen a revival of Ottoman tradition, greeting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanlı torunu). This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term külliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kampüs. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims and said that he would aim to be more like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan. President Erdoğan and his government press for court action against the remaining free press in Turkey. The latest newspaper that has been seized is Zaman. After the seizure Morton Abramowitz and Eric Edelman, former U.S. ambassadors to Turkey, condemned President Erdoğan's actions in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post: ""Clearly, democracy cannot flourish under Erdogan now."" ""The overall pace of reforms in Turkey has not only slowed down but in some key areas, such as freedom of expression and the independence of the judiciary, there has been a regression, which is particularly worrying,"" rapporteur Kati Piri said in April 2016 after the European Parliament passed its annual progress report on Turkey. On 22 June 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that he considered himself successful in ""destroying"" Turkish civil groups ""working against the state"", a conclusion that had been confirmed some days earlier by Sedat Laçiner, Professor of International Relations and rector of the Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University: ""Outlawing unarmed and peaceful opposition, sentencing people to unfair punishment under erroneous terror accusations, will feed genuine terrorism in Erdoğan's Turkey. Guns and violence will become the sole alternative for legally expressing free thought."" After the coup attempt, over 200 journalists were arrested and over 120 media outlets were closed. Cumhuriyet journalists were detained in November 2016 after a long-standing crackdown on the newspaper. Subsequently, Reporters Without Borders called Erdoğan an ""enemy of press freedom"" and said that he ""hides his aggressive dictatorship under a veneer of democracy"". In a speech broadcast live on television, President Erdoğan said on Friday, 11 March 2016: ""I hope the constitutional court would not again attempt such ways which will open its existence and legitimacy up for debate"". On 26 February, Erdoğan had said in a public speech that he did ""neither respect nor accept"" a constitutional court ruling that the detention of Can Dündar and Ekrem Gül from Cumhuriyet had violated their rights. In an interview to the news magazine Der Spiegel, the German minister of defence Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, 11 March 2016, that the refugee crisis had made good cooperation between EU and Turkey an ""existentially important"" issue. ""Therefore it is right to advance now negotiations on Turkey's EU accession"". In its resolution ""The functioning of democratic institutions in Turkey"" from 22 June 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe warned that ""recent developments in Turkey pertaining to freedom of the media and of expression, erosion of the rule of law and the human rights violations in relation to anti-terrorism security operations in south-east Turkey have ... raised serious questions about the functioning of its democratic institutions."" On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted by the military, with aims to remove Erdoğan from government, however by the next day Erdoğan’s government managed to reassert effective control in the country. Reportedly, no government official was arrested or harmed, which among other factors raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the government itself. Erdoğan, as well as other government officials, have blamed an exiled cleric, and once an ally of Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, for staging the coup attempt. Suleyman Soylu, Minister for Labor in Erdoğan's government, accused the US of planning a coup to oust Erdoğan. Erdoğan, as well as other high-ranking Turkish government officials have issued repeated demands to the US to extradite Güllen. Following the coup attempt, there has been a significant deterioration in Turkey-US relations. European and other world leaders have expressed their concerns over the situation in Turkey, with many of them warning Erdoğan not to use the coup attempt as an excuse for crackdown against his opponents. The rise of Islamic state and the collapse of the Kurdish peace process lead to a sharp rise in terrorist incidents in Turkey until 2016 Erdoğan was accused by his critics of having a 'soft corner' for ISIS However, after the attempted coup, Erdoğan ordered the Turkish military into Syria to combat ISIS and Kurdish militant groups. Erdoğan's critics have decried purges in the education system and judiciary as undermining the rule of law however Erdoğan supporters argue this is a necessary measure as Gulen-linked schools cheated on entrance exams, requiring a purge in the education system and of the Gulen followers who then entered the judiciary. Erdoğan's plan is to reconstitute Turkey as a presidential system,that would enable him to better tackle Turkey’s internal and external threats. One of the main hurdles allegedly standing in his way is Fethullah Gulen’s movement. In the aftermath of the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, a groundswell of national unity and consensus emerged against cracking down on the coup plotters with a National Unity rally held in Turkey that included Islamists, secularists, liberals and nationalists. Erdoğan has used this consensus to remove Gulen followers from the bureaucracy, curtail their role in NGOs, Turkey's Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Turkish military, with 149 Generals discharged. In a foreign policy shift Erdoğan ordered the Turkish Armed Forces into battle in Syria and has liberated towns from IS control. As relations with Europe soured over in the aftermath of the attempted coup, Erdoğan developed alternative relationships with Russia, Saudi Arabia and a ""strategic partnership"" with Pakistan, with plans to cultivate relations through free trade agreements and deepening military relations for mutual co-operation with Turkey's regional allies. On 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan declared the state of emergency, citing the coup d'état attempt as justification. It was first scheduled to last three months. The Turkish parliament approved this measure. The state of emergency was later extended for another three months, amidst the ongoing 2016 Turkish purges including comprehensive purges of independent media and detention of tens of thousands of Turkish citizens politically opposed to Erdoğan. Early during his prime ministership, Erdoğan was praised as a role model for emerging Middle Eastern nations due to several reform packages initiated by his government which expanded religious freedoms and minority rights as part of accession negotiations with the European Union. However, his government underwent several crises including the Sledgehammer and Ergenekon cases against the Turkish Armed Forces, corruption scandals, accusations of media intimidation, as well as the pursuit of an increasingly polarising political agenda; the opposition accused the government of inciting political hatred throughout the country. Central to the accusations of authoritarianism are Erdoğan's controversial ties with exiled Islamic cleric and former ally Fethullah Gülen, who has been accused of calling for the dismantling of the secular Turkish state in favour of an Islamic Republic, although Gülen had been acquitted in 2006 of the charge, based on the same alleged statements, of trying to overturn the government. In response to criticism, Erdoğan made a speech in May 2014 denouncing allegations of dictatorship, saying that the leader of the opposition, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was there at the speech, would not be able to ""roam the streets"" freely if he was a dictator. Kılıçdaroğlu responded that political tensions would cease to exist if Erdoğan stopped making his polarising speeches for three days. One observer said it was a measure of the state of Turkish democracy that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu could openly threaten, on 20 December 2015, that, if his party did not win the election, his country's Kurds would endure a repeat of the era of the ""white Toros"", the Turkish name for the Renault 12, ""a car associated with the gendarmarie's fearsome intelligence agents, who carried out thousands of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish nationalists during the 1990s."" In February 2015, a 13-year-old child was arrested after allegedly criticising Erdoğan on Facebook. In 2016, a waiter was arrested for not serving tea to Erdoğan. Erdoğan referred to the Turkish novelist and Islamist ideologue, Necip Fazıl Kısakürek, as his muse. Kısakürek was regarded by some analysts, such as Günther Jikeli and Kemal Silay, as the source of his views on Jews. Kısakürek's publications included the Turkish translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and praise for industrialist Henry Ford's The International Jew, as well as a political program in which he wrote: “Chief among these treacherous and insidious elements to be cleansed are the Dönmeh and the Jews"". A 2009 report issued by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said that Erdoğan ""indirectly incites and encourages"" antisemitism. In 2013, Erdoğan was placed second on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of the year's top ten antisemitic personalities, after Erdoğan blamed the ""interest rate lobby"" as organizers of the mass protests against him in cities around the country in June 2013. In another quote that was regarded as antisemitic, he said ""When the word 'media' is pronounced, Israel and Israel's administration comes to mind. They have the ability to manipulate it as they wish."" He then claimed that not only the international press but also Turkish newspapers were run by Israel. During the campaign for the Turkish elections in June 2015, Erdoğan accused The New York Times of being represented by ""Jewish capital"" after foreign media outlets expressed concern over the corrosion of freedom of expression in Turkey. When during a televised press conference he was asked if he believed a presidential system was possible in a unitary state he affirmed this and cited Nazi Germany as an example of how this is possible. However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive. Furthermore, that the Turkish president had declared the Holocaust, anti-semitism and Islamophobia as crimes against humanity and that it was out of the question for him to cite Hitler's Germany as a good example. The judiciary has traditionally adhered to strict secular principles as outlined in the Constitution of Turkey. This resulted in the closing down of two former parties of which Erdoğan was a member, namely the Welfare Party in 1998 and the Virtue Party in 2001. The judiciary was thus seen as a significant threat to the Justice and Development Party (AKP). In 2008, the Constitutional Court of Turkey heard a case in favour of closing down the AKP and banning 71 senior members from politics for five years. Although the AKP survived closure, it lost 50% of its state funding. In April 2014, the President of the Constitutional Court, Haşim Kılıç, accused Erdoğan of damaging the credibility of the judiciary, labelling Erdoğan's attempts to increase political control over the courts as 'desperate'. Both the military and judiciary were widely known for their secular credentials, both therefore representing a threat to Erdoğan's moderately Islamist government. During the chaotic 2007 presidential election, the military issued an E-memorandum warning the government to keep within the boundaries of secularism when choosing a candidate. Regardless, Erdoğan's close relations with Fethullah Gülen and his Cemaat Movement allowed his government to maintain a degree of influence within the judiciary through Gülen's supporters in high judicial and bureaucratic offices. Shortly after, an alleged coup plot codenamed Sledgehammer became public and resulted in the imprisonment of 300 military officers including İbrahim Fırtına, Çetin Doğan and Engin Alan. Several opposition politicians, journalists and military officers also went on trial for allegedly being part of an ultra-nationalist organisation called Ergenekon. Both cases were marred by irregularities and were condemned as a joint attempt by Erdoğan and Gülen to curb opposition to the AKP. The original Sledgehammer document containing the coup plans, allegedly written in 2003, was found to have been written using Microsoft Word 2007. Despite both domestic and international calls for these irregularities to be addressed in order to guarantee a fair trial, Erdoğan instead praised his government for bringing the coup plots to light. When Gülen publicly withdrew support and openly attacked Erdoğan in late 2013, several imprisoned military officers and journalists were released, with the government admitting that the judicial proceedings were unfair. When Gülen withdrew support from the AKP government in late 2013, a government corruption scandal broke out, leading to the arrest of several family members of cabinet ministers. Erdoğan accused Gülen of co-ordinating a ""parallel state"" within the judiciary in an attempt to topple him from power. He then removed or reassigned several judicial officials in an attempt to remove Gülen's supporters from office. Erdoğan's 'purge' was widely questioned and criticised by the European Union. In early 2014, a new law was passed by parliament giving the government greater control over the judiciary, which sparked public protest throughout the country. International organisations perceived the law to be a danger to the separation of powers. Several judicial officials removed from their posts said that they had been removed due to their secularist credentials. The political opposition accused Erdoğan of not only attempting to remove Gülen supporters, but supporters of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's principles as well, in order to pave the way for increased politicisation of the judiciary. Several family members of Erdoğan's ministers who had been arrested as a result of the 2013 corruption scandal were released, and a judicial order to question Erdoğan's son Bilal Erdoğan was annulled. Controversy erupted when it emerged that many of the newly appointed judicial officials were actually AKP supporters. İslam Çiçek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers' relatives accused of corruption, was accused of being an AKP supporter and an official investigation was launched into his political affiliations. On 1 September 2014, the courts dissolved the cases of 96 suspects, which included Bilal Erdoğan. Erdoğan has been criticised for his politicisation of the media, especially after the 2013 protests. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) alleged that over 1,863 journalists lost their jobs due to their anti-government views in 12 years of AKP rule. Opposition politicians have also alleged that intimidation in the media is due to the government's attempt to restructure the ownership of private media corporations. Journalists from the Cihan News Agency and the Gülenist Zaman newspaper were repeatedly barred from attending government press conferences or asking questions. Several opposition journalists such as Soner Yalçın were controversially arrested as part of the Ergenekon trials and Sledgehammer coup investigation. Veli Ağbaba, a CHP politician, has called the AKP the 'biggest media boss in Turkey.' In 2015, 74 US senators sent a letter to US Secretary of State, John Kerry, to state their concern over what they saw as deviations from the basic principles of democracy in Turkey and oppressions of Erdoğan over media. Notable cases of media censorship occurred during the 2013 anti-government protests, when the mainstream media did not broadcast any news regarding the demonstrations for three days after they began. The lack of media coverage was symbolised by CNN International covering the protests while CNN Türk broadcast a documentary about penguins at the same time. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) controversially issued a fine to pro-opposition news channels including Halk TV and Ulusal Kanal for their coverage of the protests, accusing them of broadcasting footage that could be morally, physically and mentally destabilising to children. Erdoğan was criticised for not responding to the accusations of media intimidation, and caused international outrage after telling a female journalist (Amberin Zaman of The Economist) to know her place and calling her a 'shameless militant' during his 2014 presidential election campaign. While the 2014 presidential election was not subject to substantial electoral fraud, Erdoğan was again criticised for receiving disproportionate media attention in comparison to his rivals. The British newspaper The Times commented that between 2 and 4 July, the state-owned media channel TRT gave 204 minutes of coverage to Erdoğan's campaign and less than a total of 3 minutes to both his rivals. Erdoğan also tightened controls over the internet, signing into law a bill which allows the government to block websites without prior court order on 12 September 2014. His government blocked Twitter and YouTube in late March 2014 following the release of a recording of a conversation between him and his son Bilal, where Erdoğan allegedly warned his family to 'nullify' all cash reserves at their home amid the 2013 corruption scandal. Erdoğan has undertaken a media campaign that attempts to portray the presidential family as frugal and simple-living; their palace electricity-bill is estimated at $500,000 per month. Despite extensive censorship, Erdoğan has become the world's most insulted president, according to Burak Bekdil writing in the Gatestone Institute. Insults have been punished with prison sentences; for example, in May 2016, former Miss Turkey model Merve Büyüksaraç was sentenced to more than a year in prison for allegedly insulting the president. In a 2016 news story, Bloomberg reported, ""more than 2,000 cases have been opened against journalists, cartoonists, teachers, a former Miss Turkey, and even schoolchildren in the past two years."" In November 2016, the Turkish government blocked access to social media in all of Turkey as well as sought to completely block internet access for the citizens in the Southeast of the country. Erdoğan's government developed the SEÇSİS secure vote counting system in order to reduce fraud. However, it has been criticised for being prone to manipulation. Particular controversy was generated by the fact that the system was developed in the United States. The first significant cases of election fraud under Erdoğan's rule were documented during the 2009 local elections, where numerous cases of ballot paper theft were reported in Ankara and Adana. In the 2011 general election, a minivan containing ballot papers with a pre-stamped vote for the AKP was impounded by police in İzmir. An independent candidate from Yalova also accused officials at polling stations of intimidating voters to vote for the AKP. Substantial levels of fraud were documented during the 2014 local elections, including the theft and burning of ballots cast both for and against the AKP and the intimidation of officials counting the votes, including European Union Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, by government forces. Several cases of opposition votes being counted as invalid and vote totals per ballot box being recorded incorrectly also caused controversy. With an unusually high number of power outages occurring throughout the country while votes were being counted, the government was ridiculed when Energy Minister Taner Yıldız blamed them on cats entering transformers. Erdoğan was criticised for disregarding the high number of fraud cases and declaring victory none-the-less. Significant cases of misconduct were documented in Yalova, Ankara, Antalya and Ağrı. The Supreme Electoral Council ordered a repeat of the election in Yalova and Ağrı, both of which the AKP had initially narrowly lost to the CHP and BDP respectively. Despite strong surveillance by citizens during the 2014 presidential election, no serious cases of fraud were documented during the voting or counting process. However, Erdoğan was still heavily scrutinised over what was perceived to be excessive media bias in his favour during the campaigning process. Political polarisation in Turkey soared during the 2013–14 anti-government protests, due to the government's response. A more general polarisation was caused by the undermining of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's principles and the Constitution, which created tension between secularists and government supporters. Both have been allegedly fuelled by Erdoğan's ignorance of the opposition, as well as strongly partisan speeches which have referred to anti-government protestors as 'looters,' 'terrorists,' and 'traitors.' In 2009, Turkish sculptor Mehmet Aksoy created the Statue of Humanity in Kars to promote reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia. When visiting the city in 2011, Erdoğan deemed the statue a ""freak"", and months later it was demolished. Aksoy sued Erdoğan for ""moral indemnities"", although his lawyer said that his statement was a critique rather than an insult. In March 2015, a judge ordered Erdoğan to pay Aksoy 10,000 lira. In January 2016, more than a thousand academics signed a petition criticizing Turkey's military crackdown on ethnic Kurdish towns and neighbourhoods in the east of the country, such as Sur (a district of Diyarbakır), Silvan, Nusaybin, Cizre and Silopi, and asking an end to violence. Erdoğan accused those who signed the petition of ""terrorist propaganda"", calling them ""the darkest of people"". He called for action by institutions and universities, stating, ""Everyone who benefits from this state but is now an enemy of the state must be punished without further delay."" Within days, over 30 of the signatories were arrested, many in dawn-time raids on their homes. Although all were quickly released, nearly half were fired from their jobs, eliciting a denunciation from Turkey's Science Academy for such ""wrong and disturbing"" treatment. Erdoğan vowed that the academics would pay the price for ""falling into a pit of treachery"". On 1 May 2016, a controversial anonymous blog post named The Pelican Brief demanded the resignation of Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu. On 4 May Ahmet Davutoglu met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Presidential Complex and it was announced Davutoglu that would not run for leadership again in the upcoming special party congress. It was described as a palace coup d'état on Turkish social media and by other sources. Erdoğan is a co-founder of the so-called ""Alliance of Civilizations"" (AOC). The AOC initiative was proposed by the Prime Minister of Spain, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2005. The initiative seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through the forging of international, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and cooperation. Erdoğan was named ""European of the Year 2004"" by the newspaper European Voice for the reforms in his country. He said, ""Turkey's accession shows that Europe is a continent where civilisations reconcile and not clash."" On 3 October 2005, during Erdoğan's tenure as Prime Minister, negotiations for Turkey's accession to the EU formally started. Erdoğan's government is not unconditionally pro-European. The European Commission generally supports Erdoğan's reforms, but remains critical of his policies. Negotiations about possible EU membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships. Furthermore, fundamental rights remain an issue in Turkey. A law establishing the Turkish National Human Rights Institution was adopted by the Turkish parliament, but the law does not comply fully with the UN Paris principles on human rights institutions. In a 2012 European Commission report about possible Turkish accession to the European Union, the Commission specifically mentioned the lack of the freedoms of;expression, thought, conscience, religion and assembly as well as restricted access to; independent and impartial justice, children's rights, and trade union rights, as areas where the Turkish government needs to implement reforms. Freedom of the press continues to be restricted in practice, according to the report. No progress was made on anti-discrimination policies, such as discrimination against homosexuals. The position of socially vulnerable persons and/or persons with disabilities, torture in prisons and the issue of violence against women in relationships outside marriage, as well as early and forced marriages, also remain concerns, according to the report. In February 2016, Erdoğan has threatened to send the millions of refugees in Turkey to EU member states, saying: ""We can open the doors to Greece and Bulgaria anytime and we can put the refugees on buses ... So how will you deal with refugees if you don't get a deal? Kill the refugees?"" During Erdoğan's Prime Ministership, relations with Greece were normalized and political and economic relations improved significantly. In 2007, Erdoğan and Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis met on the bridge over the Evros River, at the border between Greece and Turkey, for the inauguration of the Greek-Turkish natural gas pipeline. Linking the longtime Aegean rivals, this project will give Caspian gas its first direct Western outlet and help ease Russia's energy dominance. Turkey and Greece signed an agreement to create a Combined Joint Operational Unit within the framework of NATO to participate in Peace Support Operations. Erdoğan and his party strongly supported the EU-backed referendum to reunify Cyprus in 2004. Negotiations about Turkey's possible EU membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships in ""revenge"" for the economic isolation of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the failure of the EU to end the isolation, as it had promised in 2004. The Turkish government continues its refusal to recognize the Republic of Cyprus. Armenia is Turkey's only neighbouring country that Erdoğan did not visit during his prime ministry. Turkish-Armenian relations are difficult due to the denial of the Armenian Genocide by Erdoğan and have been frozen since 1993 because of the Nagorno-Karabakh War with Turkey's close ally Azerbaijan. Diplomatic efforts resulted in the signing of protocols by the Turkish and Armenian Foreign Ministers in Switzerland to improve relations between the two countries in 2010. One of the points of the agreement was the creation of a joint commission on the issue. The Armenian Constitutional Court decided that the commission contradicts the Armenian constitution. Turkey said that the Armenian court's ruling on the protocols was not acceptable. The parliament of Armenia and Turkey's National Assembly decided to suspend the ratification process. On 5 August 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in a televised interview on NTV news network, remarked that being Armenian is ""uglier"" even than being Georgian, saying ""You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian ... they have said even uglier things – they have called me Armenian, but I am Turkish."" Erdoğan made his first official visit to Egypt on 12 September 2011, accompanied by six ministers and 200 businessmen. This visit was considered a diplomatic success. It was made very soon after Turkey had ejected Israeli ambassadors, cutting all diplomatic and bilateral military agreements because Israel refused to apologize for the Gaza flotilla raid which killed eight Turkish and one Turco-American aboard a convoy headed to Gaza. This was the first visit to Egypt by a Prime Minister of Turkey in 15 years and the first after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Erdoğan's visit to Egypt was met with much enthusiasm by Egyptians. Even though it was midnight, Cairo traffic was reported to be jammed as thousands rushed to welcome the Turkish Prime Minister with Turkish flags. CNN reported some Egyptians saying ""We consider him as the Islamic leader in the Middle East"", while others were appreciative of his role in supporting Gaza. Erdoğan was later honored in Tahrir Square by members of the Egyptian Revolution Youth Union, and members of the Turkish embassy were presented with a coat of arms in acknowledgment of the Prime Minister's support of the Egyptian Revolution. His visit brought criticism from Middle Eastern Christians, however, when he drew comparisons in a speech between the fall of Mubarak and the Fall of Constantinople, describing the Byzantine Empire as a ""dark civilization"". When asked in an interview with Mona Al Shazly on Dream TV, Erdoğan stated that he recommended secularism for Egypt, which generated rage among Islamic movements, especially the Freedom and Justice party – the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. A week after he left, Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu proclaimed his vision of a strategic alliance between Turkey and Egypt, which he described as an ""Axis of Democracy"". However, some voiced concerns that the Egyptian revolution was not fulfilled and that Erdoğan was seeking his own country's strategic interests. It was feared that by forming an alliance with the military junta in Egypt during the country's transition to democracy, Erdoğan may have tipped the balance in favor of those that stood between the Egyptians and their freedom. In July 2014, after Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2013, Erdoğan called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi an ""illegitimate tyrant"". Turkey under Erdoğan was named by the Bush Administration as a part of the ""coalition of the willing"" that was central to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Under Erdoğan, Iraq and Turkey signed 48 trade agreements at the Iraqi-Turkish Strategic Council in Baghdad. Agreements were signed on issues including security, energy, oil, electricity, water, health, trade, environment, transport, housing, construction, agriculture, education, higher education, and defense. The Turkish government mended relations with Iraqi Kurdistan by opening a Turkish university in Arbil, and a Turkish consulate in Mosul. On 23 March 2009, Abdullah Gül became the first Turkish head of state to visit Iraq in 33 years. Erdoğan's government fostered very strong economic and political relations with Irbil, and Turkey has begun to consider the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq as an ally against Maliki's government. In March 2015, Erdoğan criticized Iran's regional ambitions in Iraq. On 1 May 2005, in a rare state visit by a leader of a Muslim majority country, Turkey's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, came to Israel offering to serve as a Middle East peace mediator and looking to build on trade and military ties. Along with him bringing a delegation of businessmen to further economic ties. During his visit to Israel, Erdoğan also visited the Yad Vashem, which is Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The President of Israel Shimon Peres addressed the Turkish parliament during a visit in 2007, the first time an Israeli leader had addressed the legislature of a predominantly Muslim nation. At the 2009 World Economic Forum conference, debate became heated in relation to the Gaza War. Peres responded to Erdoğan, stating that Turkey would have done the same if rockets had been hitting Istanbul. Erdoğan was interrupted by the moderator while he was responding to Peres: ""Mister Peres, you are older than I am. Maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are raising your voice. When it comes to killing you know it too well. I remember how you killed the children on beaches ..."" Upon the moderator's reminder that they needed to adjourn for dinner, Erdoğan left the panel, accusing the moderator of giving Peres more time than all the other panelists combined. Following the Gaza flotilla raid in May 2010, tension between the two countries mounted. Erdoğan strongly condemned the raid, describing it as ""state terrorism"", and called for the Israeli leaders responsible to apologize. Erdoğan described Israel as ""the main threat to regional peace"", and called for Israel's nuclear facilities to come under IAEA inspection. Erdoğan accused Israel of turning Gaza into an ""open-air prison"". UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon subsequently described Erdoğan's remarks as ""hurtful and divisive."" During the March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes, Erdoğan demanded that Israel must stop the 'massacre' of Palestinians in Gaza, saying that it was a part of an Israeli campaign of ""genocide"" against the Palestinian people. In February 2013, Erdoğan called Zionism a ""crime against humanity"", comparing it to Islamophobia, antisemitism, and fascism. He later retracted the statement, saying he had been misinterpreted. He said ""everyone should know"" that his comments were directed at ""Israeli policies,"" especially as regards to ""Gaza and the settlements."" Erdoğan also said ""in several statements I openly condemned anti-Semitism, and it clearly displays my position on this issue."" Erdoğan's branding of Zionism as a crime against humanity was condemned by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, criticized by the US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and called unacceptable by the German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. In August 2013, the Hürriyet reported that Erdoğan had stated to a meeting of the AKP's provincial chairs that Israel was responsible for the military coup in Egypt which overthrew Mohammad Morsi. Erdoğan reportedly stated ""Who is behind this? Israel. We have evidence"". Specifically, Erdoğan cited a video posted online of Tzipi Livni speaking with French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy. Erdoğan alleged that Levy said: ""The Muslim Brotherhood will not be in power even if they win the elections, because democracy is not the ballot box."" However, what Levy said was: ""If the Muslim Brotherhood arrives in Egypt, I will not say democracy wants it, so let democracy progress. Democracy is not only elections, it is also values ... I will urge the prevention of  coming to power, but by all sorts of means."" The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later stated that Erdoğan's accusation was ""a statement well worth not commenting on"". Egypt's interim government rejected Erdoğan' allegations, describing it as ""baseless"", and charged that ""Its purpose is to strike at the unity of Egyptians."" Relations between the two countries began to normalize after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu officially apologized for the death of the nine Turkish activists during the Gaza flotilla raid. However, in response to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Erdoğan accused Israel of being ""more barbaric than Hitler"", and conducting ""state terrorism"" and a ""genocide attempt"" against the Palestinians. He also stated that ""If Israel continues with this attitude, it will definitely be tried at international courts."" In December 2004, Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Turkey. This was only the second presidential visit in the history of Turkish-Russian relations after that of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolai Podgorny, in 1972. In November 2005, Putin attended the inauguration of a jointly constructed Blue Stream natural gas pipeline in Turkey. This sequence of top-level visits brought several important bilateral issues to the forefront. The two countries consider it their strategic goal to achieve ""multidimensional co-operation"", especially in the fields of energy, transport and the military. Specifically, Russia aims to invest in Turkey's fuel and energy industries, and it also expects to participate in the modernisation of Turkey's military. In 2010, then-President Dmitry Medvedev described Turkey as ""one of our most important partners with respect to regional and international issues"", adding, ""We can confidently say that Russian-Turkish relations have advanced to the level of a multidimensional strategic partnership."" On 12 May 2010, Ankara and Moscow signed 17 agreements to enhance cooperation in energy and other fields, including pacts to build Turkey's first nuclear power plant and further plans for an oil pipeline from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The leaders of both countries also signed an agreement on visa-free travel, enabling tourists to get into the country for free and stay there for up to 30 days. Erdoğan is defender of the Crimean Tatars' minority rights. He said after meeting with Crimean Tatar leaders in August 2015: ""Unfortunately, throughout history, the right of the Crimean Tatar people to live in dignity in their own homeland was undermined with collective deportations and repression. Today we are witnessing the illegal annexation of the Crimea and other regrettable events."" On 20 August 2016 Erdoğan told his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko that Turkey would not recognize the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea; calling it ""Crimea's occupation"". Diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia were established in 1929. In recent years, importance has been given to regional issues and to the improvement of bilateral relations to strengthen political, economic and military ties. In August 2006, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz as-Saud made a visit to Turkey. This was the first visit by a Saudi monarch to Turkey in four decades. The monarch made a second visit on 9 November 2007. Turkish-Saudi trade volume exceeded US$ 3.2 billion in 2006, almost double the figure achieved in 2003. In 2009, this amount reached US$ 5.5 billion and the goal for the year 2010 was US$ 10 billion. Trade is expected to increase further as the strategic locations of both countries mean their economies are in a position to supplement each other. In March 2015, Erdoğan said that Turkey supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Erdoğan's administration maintained strong ties with the Federal Government of Somalia. Following a greatly improved security situation in Mogadishu in mid-2011, the Turkish government re-opened its foreign embassy with the intention of more effectively assisting in the post-conflict development process. It was among the first foreign administrations to resume formal diplomatic relations with Somalia after the civil war. Development cooperation between Turkey and Somalia is multi-tiered, and includes military, social, economic and infrastructural partnerships. In May 2010, the Turkish and Somali governments signed a military training agreement, in keeping with the provisions outlined in the Djibouti Peace Process. Enforcement of the pact officially began in November 2012. Outlining training, technical and scientific cooperation, the treaty includes joint-service exercises between both national militaries and exchanges of delegations and personnel. It also encompasses training by the Turkish Military Medical Academy and Mapping General Command, between the gendarmerie and coast guard, as well as in-field training and education at national military installations and institutions. Additionally, the agreement includes provisions for the mutual exchange of information vis-a-vis military history, publications and museology. Turkish Airlines became the first long-distance international commercial airline in two decades to resume flights to and from Mogadishu's Aden Adde International Airport. In September 2013, the Turkish company Favori LLC began operations at the airport. In partnership with the Somali government, Turkish officials also launched various development and infrastructure projects in Somalia. They have assisted in the building of several hospitals, and helped renovate and rehabilitate the National Assembly building, among other initiatives. In May 2013, the 1st Turkish-Somali Business Forum was held in Istanbul to highlight commercial opportunities in both Turkey and Somalia for Turkish and Somali businesses. Organized by the Somali Council in conjunction with Turkish and Somali government ministries, the event included roundtable discussions on potential commercial ventures in both countries as well as business-to-business meetings between Turkish and Somali firms. During Erdoğan's term of office, diplomatic relations between Turkey and Syria significantly deteriorated. At first there were hopeful signs. In 2004, President Bashar al-Assad arrived in Turkey for the first official visit by a Syrian President in 57 years. In late 2004, Erdoğan signed a free trade agreement with Syria. Visa restrictions between the two countries were lifted in 2009, which caused an economic boom in the regions near the Syrian border. Before the Syrian civil war Erdoğan and al-Assad were described by The Economist as ""the best of friends"". However, in 2011, the relationship between the two countries was strained following the outbreak of conflict in Syria. Erdoğan said he was trying to ""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad"". However, he began to directly support the armed opposition in Syria, creating a serious Syrian refugee problem in Turkey, conflict over armed fighter bases in Turkey, and an unpopular conflict with Syria. Erdoğan's policy of providing military training for anti-Damascus fighters has also created conflict with Syria's ally, Iran. As of 2015, Turkey is actively supporting the Army of Conquest, an umbrella Syrian rebel group that reportedly includes an al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al-Sham. Al-Nusra Front and Islamic State (ISIL) sometimes cooperate with each other when they fight against the Syrian government. In late November 2016, Erdoğan said that the Turkish military launched its operations in Syria to end the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Days later, Erdoğan sought to retract his statement; media observers attributed his outburst to frustration due to failure of his government's Syria policies. In an interview with the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency on 8 December, Syria President Bashar al-Assad said that ""as long as the Turkish policy is run by an abnormal and psychologically-disturbed person like Erdogan, we have to expect all possibilities"". When Barack Obama became President of the United States, he made his first overseas bilateral meeting visit to Turkey in April 2009. At a joint news conference in Turkey, Obama said: ""I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world. I think that where there's the most promise of building stronger U.S.-Turkish relations is in the recognition that Turkey and the United States can build a model partnership in which a predominantly Christian nation, a predominantly Muslim nation – a Western nation and a nation that straddles two continents,"" he continued, ""that we can create a modern international community that is respectful, that is secure, that is prosperous, that there are not tensions – inevitable tensions between cultures – which I think is extraordinarily important."" In terms of his successes in elections and referenda, Erdoğan is one of the most successful politicians in the Republican era of Turkish history. Since 1994, he has taken part in 3 general elections, 3 local elections, 1 by-election and 2 referenda, none of which he has lost. The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdoğan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yılmaz and Çiller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdoğan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdoğan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%. In the June 2011 elections, Erdoğan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdoğan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gül as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Çanakkale, and one million in İzmir on 13 May. Early parliamentary elections were called after the failure of the parties in parliament to agree on the next Turkish president. The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdoğan spoke of a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution. Gül was later elected President after the general elections on 22 July 2007 that saw AKP and Erdoğan brought back to power with 46.7% of the vote. Later in 2007, a Turkish constitutional referendum was approved with the support of 69% of voters to modify the constitution to allow the people to elect the President. In 1994 Erdoğan was elected Mayor of Istanbul, one of the biggest metropolitan areas of the world. He received 25.19% of the popular vote. After the AKP won the 2002 general elections under the leadership of Erdoğan, it has received more votes in the 2004 local elections. The AKP was the biggest party in 12 out of 16 metropolitan municipality. The Turkish local elections of 2009 took place during the financial crisis of 2007–2010. In these elections the AKP received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AKP won in Turkey's two largest cities: Ankara and Istanbul. After the opposition parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by president Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The Turkish constituonal court did not find any problems in the packet and 68.95% of the voters supported the constitutional changes. The reforms consisted of: electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament, reducing the presidential term from seven years to five, allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term, holding general elections every four years instead of five and reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184. Reforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a Constitutional Commission (Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu). The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to instantly become law, but secured 336 votes in the 550 seat parliament – enough to put the proposals to a referendum. The reform package included a number of issues such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the ombudsman's office, the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract, gender equality, the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military, the right of civil servants to go on strike, a privacy law, and the structure of the Constitutional Court. The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%. (in German)  "
